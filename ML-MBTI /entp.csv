comparisons announcing her candidacy feels like a money in the bank title shot cash in nuisance political candidate orwrestling gimmick now seems like a valid game makes it harder to takeseriously

for his own loneliness forget it all the bands i wanted to see at played early apparently sigh maybe i ll go after midnite for fools and foes for the pinoy context it not one specific resource it from actively reading the comments on thefb group but after researching actual posts from filipino mras guys who seriously internalize beta uprising i see how toxic it gets personally i get the misguided nice guy pov so it wasn t hard to write a hopefully plausible pinoy mra type antagonist for the alleged motive for the beta revolt is painfully close to stuff from mystory may the victims find justice

pinoy viewers imho pern w a mastered the man game lawyering arms money braggadocio a black mirror held up to us capitalism so far so cavalier re firearms for all the rights based rhetoric it matter of factly backed by loaded guns frames n w a rise to fame as creators learning to be entrepreneurs refreshingly honest re how much image matters so farhas been the kind of grim stylizedtale that drawn

piece really a battering ram but hey it got my attention realization myplot kinda feels like a homage to my nd faveep dead things well minus the tech wizardry and demons gah myconcept has so much backstory it feels like i m plotting a standalone sequel a la silence of the lambs or freak there also the challenge to make it seem possible that a crime like this would happen at all believable circumstances are key it kinda liberating to write an unlikely crime in the phl setting because there no precedent in readers minds buuuut huge realization i plan to write about a crime that has

died fantastic actor and brilliant as winston smith in nineteen eighty four that true are you a foot fetishist piers the bbc needs on screen subtitles whenever diane abbott speaks because i don t understand bollocks what in your opinion constitutes a good trade deal with the us has trump told you what he might offer nearly every tv commercial in the usa is for over the counter drugs that never happens in the uk thank goodness for the nhs yeah ensure the proles tune into your propaganda channel of choice i thinkshould invoke particle and teleport himself back to the it obviously not fascism if someone is unwilling or unable to defend their stance in a free and fra one of the quirkiest b sides i ve come across on youtube maybe it could be the uk entry for he dented your precious ego that

upcoming by elections and the next general election in the b where the like button gone from your facebook page most labour constituencies voted to leave it like the game you lose every time you

a comma or an apostrophe correction in history i d love to remember where and when i stepped into this weird parallel universe we re all locked inside a mike judge movie it like being on a bad weed trip and it getting worse he right you know if trump thinks he above being scrutinised and held to account then he can think again she should pull his trousers down and snigger at his tiny penis sowing the seeds of world war bit nippy on pluto also it would take nearly hours to send a tweet new zealand has always felt like an attractive alternative it also one of the most unlikely countries to be nuked padlocking the fridge london protest i ain t seen a single banner or sign denouncing islamic countries treatment of women yet but i ll keep my eyes peeled with just words the whole world jolts forward into a new age nigel trump doesn t need to stir the eu into oblivion italy banks are going to that eu gone in oh my was absolutely hilarious free movement has been a disaster for the working class across europe but especially here in britain the eu isn t even the present it been paralysed since june and gdp percentage growth is the main measure of economic performance yo one of the few economists who correctly predicted events over the last period of time ttip has already been squished by the incoming us administration jim mellon explains why the euro and eu are failing currency fluctuations happen all the time it not an indicator of economic performance we trade with non eu countries as part of the eu and there not even a trade deal best performing economy in the eu low unemployment low taxes i don what the alternative valiantly cling onto the eu sinking ship and be dragged down when it sinks ben there are far more benefits to leaving a failing system than staying in there are more countries outside the eu to trade with than inside it the single market is an outdate andrew neil seems to be wearing a new brillo pad on his head for mind blown i wouldn t be surprised if trump agreed to review the papers he would figuratively and probably literally rip them to shreds i ought to get my google account password tattooed on my hand because i can never

gave you a little thrill but keep on point i don t even know what point you re trying to make anymore my original point is was that obama is a hypocrite there you go againreflecting what you really are in your comment i called you a twat i could have also called you deluded stupid race baiting and ignorant but didn t if that the route they re taking how long before the guardian is banned from facebook you blatantly implied i m racist so don t try to wriggle out of it i m happy to debate facts not slurs fyi i deplore identity politics racism xenophobia and the sheer lack of any coherent argument from the left what the hell has the kkk got to do with my point are you really as stupid and deluded irl as on twitter i stand for plenty of things probably far more than you so anyone who is a freethinking libertarian like me is automatically a troll please keep going this is hilarious what a trump account what does that even mean i disagree you clearly are a fool but don t worry your safe space is that way is that it i point out an irrefutable fact and you run away trump won because of people like you not russians or aliens because this is the same cia which said iraq had weapons of mass destruction government lies which led to m innocent deaths a link to a news article reporting what is essentiallyuntil any evidence is presented as yet no evidence sorry what this got to do
