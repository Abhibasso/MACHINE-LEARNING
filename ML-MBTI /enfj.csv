"61","enfj","diplomat","looks like i finally have a bridge between the internet and the commodore the sdiec drive been really impressed with pokémon go here back home lots of rarer pokémon showing up this was tonight great fi about we get off the train at the first stop in massachusetts heading back to western mass for thanksgiving courtesy of able to go door to door on foot no rental car required took a little break from reading tweets for a few weeks was a nice break but glad to be back again i don t get excited about vr overall not very useful for me but i could see myself playing with google street view on it for hours on end i must be doing something wrong with the daydream view i can t get it to comfortably fit on my head the strap is very awkward daydream view it like google cardboard but it actually works looks like i missed the window to get that keyboard wrist rest yeah let us know when you re going to be here in the city and we can figure out the logistics the keyboard is different but i think easier to type on as far as the touch bar goes i d forgotten about this game for the commodore until i ran across it tonight used to play lemonade for hours no reservations now that i have it in hand i m very happy about my decision to get it the following emojis are brought to you courtesy of the new macbook pro touch bar new mbp arrived today still migrating so only got to use it briefly but already i welcome our new usb c thunderbolt and touch bar overlords how can you still have a bad day after seeing this there were so many great commodore programmers in the who really knew machine language and could work magic with k which turns out to be good because the hardware just got all goofy five minutes ago and wouldn t boot in all fairness it years old the mac has excellent emulators for commodore hardware this actual hardware is only for those times when the emulator isn t enough i m just sitting here staring at that screen listening to the hz buzz from the monitor and basking in all the childhood memories got the disk drives datasette and waiting on sd drive yes an sd drive for a c need cassette tapes and floppies now i never had a commodore before you basically get three systems in one c c and cp m with the how exciting ebay is a real gamble sometimes but i ve managed to luck out finding a commodore and commodore monitor both in fantastic condition finally got the last piece this morning to get this system working i can t begin to express the happiness this bri wgn should work that what we have on but seriously that so sad i don t know how tech workers there tolerate that pedestrian hostile environment walking is dumb you should have a rental car for crossing the street to get to the strip mall like a normal american knowing me you can probably figure it out ordered my friendcalls it the iphone minus it wasn t and there weren t basic was simple but cryptic i needed a teacher to help me through some concepts before it clicked if you ve never heard of a c or never had one watch this video it worth it just for the ness of it and it really makes you appreciate how raw computers and the data they work on really are and how underneath the covers there is no magic i have a new respect for the c it was a device that a person could actually grasp from the software all the way down to the chip but the best part has been rediscovering an old friend that you can now have a meaningful adult conversation with and truly appreciate found great books emulators software and cartridge images i ve just been blown away by the dedication to commodore so many years later spent the week poring through archived issues of compute gazette which in hindsight was some really high quality material for its time so i decided to fix that and start relearning the c what a difference years and google makes to find answers to your questions for years i ve always had regret about not understanding how the commodore and all of those programs in compute gazette worked it wasn t until my senior year in high school while taking a basic programming course that it all finally clicked and i really grasped it i got my commodore for my th birthday i loved playing and tinkering with it but sadly i never really learned how to program it my parents sent me a package of my childhood things from the last week among them was this little treasure this is some kind of trick right hasscolded you yet i finally found a practical use for my pixel c android tablet i pre ordered two of them yesterday but this still gave me a good laugh sheep view that bah ah ah ah ah d my availability to work on contract ios android projects has shifted from the beginning of october to mid october that feeling never goes away the more you learn the more you realize you don t know still pretty impressive looking did you take that with an iphone this has happened to me too it been over two months since pokémon go has been released and from what i saw atthis past week it still going strong someone yelled hey there a chansey over here and literally people started running over to the spot as fast as they could spent a few hours atplaying pokémon go today with hundreds of other people can t believe the crowds and all the pokémon there i d say my first week playing pokémon go was pretty productive corporate mathematics why should i spend hr on one developer when i can get for hr well times still equals"
