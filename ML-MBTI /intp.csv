internet content i think local weather will change the profit motive imo works as long as the right person is the customer for news stations the primary customer they are motivated by money it just the people money taken by force and appropriated by congress problems tv weather must give people something they want more than accuracy since they re most popular sorry for the next expletive language and long term it doesn t make sense for a bank to devalue their currency eventually people don t want it they are motivated by power and money the fed is controlled by banks as it is but without competition the fed may not have the same profit incentive but neither do politicians yet they are no angels among men i would trust government to make breakfast cereal or automobiles why trust them to make currency or laws i don t think this holds up if this is true in principle why not nationalize all industry why doesn t communism work general james maddog mattis comment with any other opinions few people have enough light to understand the vast darkness in their understanding so they feel omniscient there isn t much cheaper than and and they re pretty much secure and would be more so with more competition if i m fidelity i want the best most secure most widely accepted currency perhaps digital only backed by silver in the fledgling currency market today precious metals bitcoins etc we don t see widespread problems positively reputation in the market aren t cheats amp thieves avoided aren t markets not govts places of innovation the problems you list are essentially the problems the fed had now in the long run doesn t a currency issuer want a the best options there would likely be way more than three options and like search engines people would gravitate toward three best options and companies would innovate maybe they back their currency with silver gold shares of the company commodities etc there would be many options not necessarily a bank could issue paper digital currency backed by something customers trust once you become knowledgeable you have an obligation to do something dr ron paul i completely agree with you we should imo the best alternative is to just let the market work w o official i rewatched some of the gop presidential debates dr ron paul is such a hero to me his arguments are so coherent and consistent i only wish was

interesting podcasts i just started listening i see you followfolks are you a rothbardian i think i m done for tonight but it has been fun nice to meet you then why the hoopla lol the only reason google has so much search dominance is because they are good at it what do you propose govt do about it look at the recent epipen scandal here in the usa the co pany had connections to the legislature who barred competition here alternatives i could make an alternative myself but it doesn t exist at all yahoo bing duckduckgo they each provide different users something they want most in what area do they not have competition should govt force people to use crappy search engines can t fault a good site idealistically any imaginable utopia is possible including a stateless one i m talking about what govt is in truth government creates monopolies through tax credits special loop holes and partnerships google doesn t have monopoly the way to the to is providing a product of service that people think is more valuable than their money that virtuous if that what a government did but most government functions have nothing to do with protecting true rights the state does more of that than anyone else monopolies are creations of government cronies not cooperations and in the private sector there is competition we each get to choose for ourselves with government we are compelled that how huge parts of society work now you don t think anything the government does could be done privately why as long as a man is benefitted by helping others he will continue helping them supply and demand but most people do care about others in our free will society out people donate huge amounts of resources to help others did idaho farmers get up and tend to fields because they love new yorkers their self interest feeds strangers yes and no self interest has given us so much good are politicians selfless angelic beings it is impossible to predict market innovation in sectors that are currently banned but i can theorize a specific sector how can we stop theft and extortion with a government when their lifeblood is theft and extortion this is an extremely broad question the best parts of society are already free is there some area in particular i d gladly help you with any areas of confusion or frustration question away is far far too rapid and we don t see a long slowly changing chain of creatures in the fossil record we see leaps not for me for the science rapid evolution only occurs in simple short lived creatures the explosion of new creatures we are the only truly free

planted there without any evolutionary history it far too rapid well the creatures that arise in the cambrian explosion would be a good example dawkins even states really i find that interesting i think you can find a lot of intellectuals in our ranks particularly the mises variety lol i think the evidence is fairly strong certainly darwinian evolution has some serious problems of late at least that not my journey for me belief in god was the answer to a single question but has implications well certainly my theological beliefs do help inform all of my other beliefs but god isn t the answer to an equation libertarianism take a little more dot connecting and tweets probably wouldn t been a good medium for those arguments fundamentally if free will is correct calvinism and determinism

"24","intp","analyst","thoreau and civil disobedience despite my current state i find this photo of my dog to be very relaxing and it makes me happier i love the irony of this dude says women are naturally less aggressive me is super hyper from too much coffee actually insert short paragraph i drank too much coffee save me it hard for me to explain what he is like in detail but i can say that he is an intp who worked on fe amp manages other doctors now the more mature i get the more i end up like my dad knowing that i think i ll also be less liked by younger intps as this trend continues i mean i believe them to be so radical amp self serving that they could never understand how they are wrong oh no your content has just changed a bit or maybe i m just seeing things that don t exist haha i think if a nazi could understand why they shouldn t believe in genocide then they wouldn t large groups of ppl calling for genocide can get out of control fast i don t think it is an idea worth protecting im not calling for genocide and i ve decided that i think anyone calling for genocide deserves to be punched because he is supporting a group that has called for genocide i take back what i said before that not the same because it easy to imagine that he would do the same thing to the group he hates so much for no good reason i wouldn t punch someone in the face but i m not going to be sad about someone punching a nazi after the fact i think when someone dedicates themselves to hating a group based off of race or religion it very different you in a bad mood everyone thinks their truths are objective so how does one tell the difference by truths do you mean potential subjective realities that few people think about or are aware of am i actually just more alone now than before the real change being that i have become content with it and therefore less lonely i watched youtubers talk about it and referenced my own life i m sure they exist somewhere i disagree it just a way of exaggerating what someone said and it makes conversation difficult wow i m a lot less annoyed with people now also i think i ll try even harder to be nice when i disagree with someone maximize learning looking back at how i was when i was in my ti si loop i didn t realize that was what i was doing at the time it wasn t intentional is straw manning someone argument willful misunderstanding or is it a subconscious reaction to our own vulnerability and uncertainty she wrote both smarter and stronger yeah but a lot of physical jobs use machines now rather than lifting so there isn t a good reason women can t do them and she thinks all men will want to spend more time at work than with their kids and that isn t true either she thinks all women are going to want to be more focused on childcare the way she is that isn t true also she says men aren t complaining but there are groups of men who do some about dumb things amp some about real inequalities of the same things biologically men are no better at certain jobs than women she making inaccurate assumptions for something to be a biological fact it has to be true for all normal members of a given sex men and women are both capable doesn t matter who you hear more from too much as long as one realizes that radicals are outnumbered i view large groups as being a collection of many smaller groups some of which are radical oh i think it was actually kinda funny i mean they laughed about it nicely i m still friends with them i once said that to a group of people and they all just kinda looked at me guess i didn t find my people then here we go again there going to be a lot of protests during the next years whole bc of the few and refuse to see the big picture to me you are an idiotist that is all in almost every group ever there are mixtures of good and bad people and i don t care what you label yourself as if you stereotype the you will immediately be aware of who you are biased towards if you pay attention to which groups you ve stereotyped as radical and violent it was a small portion of the anti trump population ppl set cars on fire over football games smh i know an intj in their ni fi loop how would he get out of it i mean in my own time i study a lot of different things but this is specifically talking about school subjects but if you give me weeks for subjects i will learn very little and struggle the whole time give me one week to study the materials for one subject and i ll learn so much about that one subject someone at walmart thought i was a boy and that i was dating my friend who was with me bc i was buying a bear and valentine day chocolates i think male intps feel less inclined to understand fe and therefore end up with that sort of edgy humor they will grow out of it maybe my infp roommate finds me to be hilarious i think it depends on maturity it more for supporting each other than convincing others i wish more people understood that i have had a few infps like me romantically although i think it would never work because we are too similar in some ways no one would act like that if it wasn t so divided by people thinking it us vs them but sure all leftists are like that if only the entire purpose of this video wasn t to shit on everyone who disagrees with trump or decided to march i ll neglect fe somewhere else for the rest of the night you can tell i m upset bc i totally disregarded twitter etiquette and just retweeted as much as i wanted to sorry about that on the back yeah and unlike most problems it gets worse the more you think about it"

felt so hopeless it baffles me that people can still think climate change is a hoax when it almost mid november and the temperature here in il is f why does every insult or comeback republicans make against democrats end in get a job and the other option was a misogynist bigot who threatened change for the worse they just had to stick with whoever it was because we basically have a two party system what people don t understand is that democrats civilians did not choose to rig the primaries that was the work of the dnc this showed up on my newsfeed and i actually snorted the saddest thing is that the the younger generation future was determined and screwed up by old bigots and racists this person who has no idea what is going on in the world is a serious presidential candidate don t treat me like shit and then expect me to make you feel better when you say you feel bad for treating me like shit be with someone who doesn t just tolerate your eccentricity but values it and joins in did i just find my soul mate told someone how much i think they suck as a person and instead of getting angry with me they agreed and made an effort to be better i m tired of trying to force myself to feel things for people it doesn t work it not the openly dark people you should fear it the happy people who claim to have no dark side people are more interesting and tolerable when just because i pretend not to notice that you are continuously staring at me doesn t mean that you should keep doing it i suppose i should have clarified that i have no idea how other girls think recently gave my friend advice on girls saying just buy them books and feed them pizza because that what would work for me i don t get ads on social media like has anyone ever gone on twitter and been like omg look at those new chips better click this link when people talk to me about art i can go on and on but for some reason as soon as they ask me something personal i forget what words are i should really stop telling people to die to those girls that talk loudly with each other in front of everyone so that you will know how interesting they think their lives are die me there something you need to know before this goes any further my cat always comes first keeps unwavering eye contact shove those emotions down and never let them out at least not here please jk sorta not really it scares me when people i like like me more it makes me wonder what so wrong with them that they have to settle for me guy i like you re so beautiful me ya you re okay does happy dance on inside haha it usually scares people because they are weak my favorite pickup line to use is i want to cling to you like soap to a baby eyes if i feel a constant urge to correct you on everything you say when we speak i will probably stop talking to you rather than correct you he speaks so well yet he types so inconsistently flattery pertaining to my looks will get you nowhere however i m slightly ashamed to admit this flattery pertaining to my art might i like showing people my shitty side first that way when they do see my okay side they won t expect me to be that way all the time i turn my music up to tune you out not because what you say affects me but because it annoys the shit out of you he thought i was joking tinder is stupid btw just going to push down these negative feels with multiple series of books and the first four episodes of game of thrones i wish someone would just slap me when i become melodramatic i will do the same for you wondering if there will ever be a day when i m not constantly told what to do by other people you lost me at god tells us oh sorry i just remembered i had to umm cant think of reason not be here walks away i hate it when drunk me sends touchy feely texts to people and then sober me has to deal with the outcome in the morning i m all for being independent but sometimes i just want someone to take care of me and sometimes i want someone to take care of i become obsessed with things for short periods of time sometimes i cringe at my own awkwardness your voice makes me want to die i don t care if you think you re cute don t interrupt the entire class and try to become the focal point i thought i should clarify don t let anyone convince you that introversion and needing alone time is unnatural or qualifies you as broken be who you are correction psychology issues like i m broken because i dont want to be around people i care about told a guy how sometimes i need to withdraw from everyone and he shouldn t take it personally his response it ok everyone has issues that wonderful moment when you habitually go to stalk that person you always stalk and suddenly realize that you don t care to do it anymore for someone who enjoys simplicity i do sure manage to complicate the shit out of my life don t ask me why i m sad because i don t know i tend to simply remove people from my life rather than deal with them i just tired of charades and drama intp in a fight vs nonintp in a fight we are fighting every fight at once they are fighting one by itself i just feel like you would look better shriveled on the ground realizing your mistakes and feeling only misery there are reasons behind my actions even if you can t understand sorry i wasn t listening i was thinking of ways to kill you the thing about passive aggressive people is that once you finally sink to their level they act like you re the crazy one at least i can always retreat back into my books and mind i find it mentally draining lol never again keeping up multiple relationships is exhausting i don t understand how other people do this i hate when people stare at me like please never look at me again say what you mean but more importantly mean what you say that all i want it just that at night i ve got nowhere to hide when i m alone for too long i can convince myself of anything this is because i don t realize how out of touch with reality i ve become i always get into relationships and they always disappoint i either need to lower my expectations and standards or be content with my cat i hate when people stare at me but then act offended when i make a point of looking annoyed and staring back you call it stalking i call it looking at information that is available online sometimes i m tempted to just ask people their personality type because i can t figure them out how i react when customers hit on me i don t thinking of detailed ways to completely destroy someone emotionally mentally and physically marginally calms me it drives
