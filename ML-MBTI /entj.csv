actual illegal votes being cast and counted not irregularities on voter registration lists percent of trump supporters said they think voter fraud happens very or somewhat often in an abc post poll in late october author of study spicer cited totoday did the non citizen vote lead to trump popular vote loss no our data doesn t support that dartmouth study the voter fraud concerns fomented and espoused by the trump campaign are not grounded trump lawyers in michigan recount case all available evidence suggests that the general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake national secretaries of state statement we are not aware of any evidence that supports the voter fraud claims made by president trump spicer says trump got the most gop electoral votes since reagan that wrong george h w bush got electoral votes in spicer cites a pew study statistic on voter fraud in briefing it was in it wasn t pew its author said trump is wrong spicer toon millions committing voter fraud

from snl stuck in my head not snarky he literally wouldn t be able to sell his merchandise at least via a campaign store without filing what he did the reason trump filing matters when your donors give small dollars and don t max out an extra two years can mean a lot more money and just for comparison obama didn t file his re election paperwork until april and george w bush didn t file it until may but for the fec a form what trump submitted is what makes you a candidate so it official trump is now a candidate for potus trump wrote in a note to federal election officials this does not constitute a formal announcement of my candidacy for the election in other news trump filed technical paperwork with the fec for a bid means he can start raising money and keep selling hats hmmmm okay

had a gift left at our door for her and can t figure out who left it it bothering her so much excellent work whoever you are the christian relies upon the holy spirit to enable him to control unruly desires on occasion he resorts to fasting as an aid the value of fasting lies not in its immediate effect but in the results which flow from its practice to the christian fasting is not a ritual to be indulged in regularly but a source of intimate delight with fasting and prayer by christians there is no ulterior motive since the glory of god alone is the object in view no christian can become victorious and useful if he ignores personal discipline self denial encourages a believer to see the lord as his all in all source of sufficiency a christian is someone who has begun to deny himself and is in the continuous process of the denying himself a selfish person is unable to enjoy the gospel teaching the boys to worship pray soak in his presence and being willing is the work of praying for every man who has taken a step forward to rise early to pray for their family and read their bible are you collecting your kids trophies if so when do you feel is a proper time to get rid of them or pass them along to your adult child the fact is that the christian life of praying does not grow naturally and without nourishment christians are not to retreat and live their lives in a corner far from the gaze of outsiders we are to live as a visible community god begins by working in a people to save them but always with a view to work through them to draw others into the blessing of his covenant god mission is a matter of the presence of the people of god in the midst of mankind and the presence of god in the midst of his people if good news was only written on your christmas card and has not come out of your mouth you re behind on understanding the good news never ending the church is sent by jesus to continue his mission and this sending defines its very nature the son sent the spirit to gather his church together and empower it to participate in his mission mission has it source in the love of the father who sent his son to reconcile all things to himself myth there is no need for mission in the west since it is already christian myth mission takes place on the non western mission field myth the world is divided into the christian west home base and the non christian non west mission field myth missions is a task for parachurch organizations while the church has only a pastoral role the real object of our prayer is the kingdom of god his rule reign and

"80","entj","analyst","training the next generation of altic leaders all chores done by am bc devotional training you are good when we pray and when we offer worship we ought to be aware of the will of god and be willing for that will to be revealed to us benefits of fasting guidance increase grace amp faith power over evil unction in preaching healing power over flesh amp breakthrough my wife had a gift left at our door for her and can t figure out who left it it bothering her so much excellent work whoever you are the christian relies upon the holy spirit to enable him to control unruly desires on occasion he resorts to fasting as an aid the value of fasting lies not in its immediate effect but in the results which flow from its practice to the christian fasting is not a ritual to be indulged in regularly but a source of intimate delight with fasting and prayer by christians there is no ulterior motive since the glory of god alone is the object in view no christian can become victorious and useful if he ignores personal discipline self denial encourages a believer to see the lord as his all in all source of sufficiency a christian is someone who has begun to deny himself and is in the continuous process of the denying himself a selfish person is unable to enjoy the gospel teaching the boys to worship pray soak in his presence and being willing is the work of praying for every man who has taken a step forward to rise early to pray for their family and read their bible are you collecting your kids trophies if so when do you feel is a proper time to get rid of them or pass them along to your adult child the fact is that the christian life of praying does not grow naturally and without nourishment christians are not to retreat and live their lives in a corner far from the gaze of outsiders we are to live as a visible community god begins by working in a people to save them but always with a view to work through them to draw others into the blessing of his covenant god mission is a matter of the presence of the people of god in the midst of mankind and the presence of god in the midst of his people if good news was only written on your christmas card and has not come out of your mouth you re behind on understanding the good news never ending the church is sent by jesus to continue his mission and this sending defines its very nature the son sent the spirit to gather his church together and empower it to participate in his mission mission has it source in the love of the father who sent his son to reconcile all things to himself myth there is no need for mission in the west since it is already christian myth mission takes place on the non western mission field myth the world is divided into the christian west home base and the non christian non west mission field myth missions is a task for parachurch organizations while the church has only a pastoral role the real object of our prayer is the kingdom of god his rule reign and right ordering of all that is wrong make sure to pray cleansing prayers over your home and family tonight may nothing formed against you stand don t carry home others issues praying foras he preaches
