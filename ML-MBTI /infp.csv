"2","infp","diplomat","how many terror attacks have refugees carried out in the united states none cnn taking a break from the hard stuff to watch my manshoot pointers i think you re preaching to the choir here i agree if trump thinks it in the best interest of the country to start a nuclear war should we all just sit quietly amp say he the boss there free speech your pastor has the right to talk about whatever he or she wants you should give jesus more power trump less loving the least among us will forever be a church issue what the heck is the role of the church if not to love the least among us you act like trump is the almighty king we can t question i m saying that choosing to care and act on behalf of people in crisis is not a state issue it a human issue it a love issue this is absurd you re gonna tell a group of refugees that you can t help them because it would be mixing the two your pastor is for sure in a position to encourage his church to show up and love people jesus was big on that stu those refugees and immigrants are god children there is no two kingdoms this is about people in need deep down you know that you re in some serious denial it a moment when millions are being discriminated against it a moment for the church to love you speak to who is in the room it starts with us caring and with encouraging people to care and act this is not about democrat versus republican it about loving people who are in crisis was it the left who said to love your enemy and to care for the least among us oh wait no that was jesus this ain t about politics do you know any muslims have you met any refugees my hunch is you would start to believe better things no trump won because of a bullshit private server story and because of russia involvement and because of fear suggests that a person running from fire might be fire a person running from fire is seeking a solution to the fire let help because this isn t about democrat versus republican it about people who have lost everything and they re searchi i m gonna keep making it along with millions of other people this is the nature of free speech and democracy if i have to choose between offending someone who voted for trump and offending someone who is fleeing violence that an easy choice the truth matters compassion matters standing up to racism amp discrimination matters refugees matter this is abo i don t speak out against trump because he a republican i speak out because bad ideas are bad ideas bad idea this isn t just something it closer to everything at the moment i m saying this is an important moment in history and every leader on the planet should be addressing it thanks my friend you re awesome i appreciate the kind words i spent days in iraq last month and the only hate i came close to was the hate these folks are trying to escape because refugees amp immigrants deserve more than better safe than sorry if you were in a crisis imagine being to jesus said to love our enemies you should follow my friendand his work with typo dig into the facts not the fear because jesus said to love our neighbor and to care for the least among us i think today news relates to both and today ban affects more than million people the church should care and show up anyone in need anyone hurting afraid tired poor jesus said to love people and to love the least among us and i think being a leader means leading when it isn t easy when the situation is messy is great example if you don t know what to say start by saying that but we can t ignore it and this moment didn t come out of nowhere we are a nation of immigrants read the words on the statue of liberty my twitter feed is rooted in helping people who are hurting at the moment politics intersects that to care about mental health is to care about people to care about people is to care about anything that affects people including politics twloha is based on helping people who are hurting but you re offended by me saying we should try to help refugees this isn t about republican versus democrat it about human decency it about compassion it about loving peo politics comes from a greek word that basically means cities which means people my work has a lot to do with today at jfk there was a suicide attempt by a woman being deported you can t care about mental health and not car i visited a syrian refugee camp in iraq last month and listened as women talked about struggling with depression a the word politics basically translates to anything that has to do with people jesus came to be with people not refugees are people on the run from terrorists they aren t a problem they are people desperately seeking a soluti when the latest news is one of the most important moments of our lifetime and it affects tens of millions of peop then don t think of it as politics think of it as loving people in need pretty sure jesus talked about that if you go to church tomorrow and the pastor doesn t talk aboutyou might want to find a different church this moment matters when we turn people away we miss out on their story and you cannot claim to love someone if you have no interest in their story a person mental health has a lot to do with their circumstances so if we care about mental health we have to care about circumstances i just watched this three times this is what a great america looks and sounds like so cool it kinda like well yes mister troll we can have this conversation but i want you to meet thousand of my cl regarding trolls i either block them or i think of their mean tweet like a pitch quote that thing and hit it out of the park yes great news but it gonna be a marathon one day at a time actually my american friend has lived there with his kids for the last years they re safe and happy you seem this little girl father was killed by isis her family welcomed and fed me in iraq but donald trump says they re this photo was taken last month in iraq according to donald trump none of these kids are welcome in america wow rooting for you guys as you get started in india peace to you from far away thanks for the work you re alrea we are on a mission to unmake violence itself with preemptive love what i need most most for my kids to be well is for my middle eastern friends to be well we are regularly hosted and protected by the people of the middle east an american who has lived in iraq for the last yrs"

your face when you laugh don t do that you are so beautiful i crave vulnerability and raw emotion and intimacy and honesty and trust but i can t even make eye contact a lot of people trust me with their darkest secrets and i ve yet to know or understand why other than the fact that i ll always listen i m trying i m trying to be okay i m trying not to notice everything that isn t okay i m trying please see that i m trying hello people i d be very grateful if you could answer or share my short survey it would really help me out wonder which mug is mine my colleagues just think i leant on the keyboard haha its actually spencer quoting winnie the pooh so technically it winnie the pooh doesn t feel good about going out cancels plans doesn t feel good about cancelling plans feels like the worst person on earth repeat she used to be mine waitress the musical on a night out i like to sit outside and listen to the bass from a different perspective it a different world in there it the script for perks of being a wallflower the film version of perks of being a wallflower it from the film version of perks of being a wallflower sometimes summoning up enough motivation to do even the things i want to do can be a challenge america i m going to try my best to trust that you saw a goodness in trump that i couldn t please be safe x how lucky am i to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard person don t forget to bring it tomorrow i won t i reply almost definitely lying when somebody tells you a secret and you have to pretend you didn t already know but you don t know how you knew in the first place if i open up to you you have about minutes until i deeply regret it and apologise for wasting your time i may seem distant i may seem uncomfortable i may seem like i want to be anywhere else but here but i never stopped listenning i lose people because i m so private they don t think that i trust them maybe i don t maybe i don t trust anybody but i still love you me simply listenning to someone talking friend comes up behind me and whispers i m so proud of you me i love you somehow in a cryptic nonsensical way this means that i love you very much i wish you could understand that meaning that one day i will love and care for you and the next you will have a very hard time even contacting me i hate inflicting myself on people but i also have to know that the people i love are okay this oxymoron does not work in my favour the feelings and emotions of the people i love feel to me like an extention of my own nobody seems to believe the extent of this hoping that the person who ignoring my messages doesn t accidentally read the message and feel the need to reply if they don t want to i consider myself to be an honest person and yet the projection of myself that i show the world is an unconscious lie do you like spoken word slam poetry i love to be alone i think this is because i can t be myself around people but there a few who i feel i can be and with them i am alone sorry don t say that what are you sorry for i think it an infp paradox i d love to be genuinely known by someone and yet somehow it so impossibly rare each to their own although i don t particularly think it a choice it seems we re just inherently enigmatic everybody filling me up with noise i don t know what they re talking about see all i need a whisper in a world that only shouts i think i am sick but never can be certain still call up my mother hiding behind curtains don t make me go don t make me go outside i did my best to assure her but assurance isn t easy to give when you ve never been sure of anything much and less so the longer you live an interesting poem about being introverted show me the truest representation of you that you have to offer and i promise not a fraction of you will i judge i m sorry that sometimes you can t see the fire inside of me but it has long learnt that some people like to piss on it how very poetic do you ever just listen to someone talking or watch someone laughing and think i want everyone to know you are you sure about this are you have you ever been sure no doctor who this is what my brain says my face and my body say something else i wish i could follow my own advice the problem is that i love people to the extent that i miss them painfully but i also can t inflict my problematic presence on those i love i often care too much sometimes a loved one problem still effects me long after they themselves have forgotten about it common misconception that infp actually show others their over sensitive vulnerable side it very rare for me if anybody has any mbti questions etc ask away i don t like to be told i have to change if i feel the decision wasn t consciously mine i will not be able to get motivated enough always being criticised for not knowing what going on on the news i m insensitive i do not like having to embrace reality"

at a loss doesn t make sense to you sass is one thing my ears will never be too feeble to hear young man at least i can start my ba and go from there so you ve been in school for awhile how has it worn on you so far don t shush your elders it would be nice if they were gap moe sometimes but yeah maybe it not always like this if they re close to person i m older than you though i guess i am still young amp hope i ll go far i ve already begun thanks i need heck yeahs spread periodically through out my life to keep the doubts at bay do i it is coincidental and thank you i m pretty sure that accurate what about you stayed in my pjs all day the rest of the weekend have to use up coupons at a store amp for ice skating homework chores she mention you a lot xd we talk about more than just mbti on here so yes i hope it will be interesting for you my name is also bri so that made it more entertaining xp update on bates motel dang he killing people left and right every night at about pm i start feeling warm amp cuddly for some reason lately mental health counselor so a master plus about years of supervised experience before licensing test oh my gosh that so hard to only choose i can t did you mention katara though same also a fav hp memory is when my isfp friend amp i messed around singing the mysterious ticking noise one of my best harry potter memories was watching the movies for the st time in w diff people no this guy was a chef fixing up a steak amp sprinkled salt on it like this i really thought it was glitter though lel oh gosh that horrible the guy could be dying or something and they gave the wrong phone number i m sure your relationship will go better than the one in my dream how is istj yes i did haha in some versions i believe he enfp i m in love with him amp peter pan tho and yeah i m kinda like i dated and then broke up with anin the same dream he was controlling amp got mad about me going to church and college what are you doing this friday afternoon i m just in bed looking up the orgin of this meme i thought it was glit what the heck samantha get your act together already it annoying employers keep calling me every once in a while on my iphone asking for a samantha lewis either they got thewrong or she gave them mine i hate feeling vulnerable to be honest math is alien unrelated to my mbti type but i do think infps generally want serious relationships i don t think the normal dating applies to me as an infp bc i have christian standards i m not sure where it came from i asked the person i got it from amp they didn t know i ll look it up though d never enough entjs on twitter welcome really want i want bc i will be spending a good chunk of my years amp money on it i definitely think people are never too old to go to college or pursue what they want but for me i want to make sure this is i ll be at least are you going to go to school to do counseling as well that would be who like change their mind because type shouldn t change after thinking they were a certain type for years like how could you not know especially if you research mbti a lot i can t either it also blows my mind when people discover they have completely opposite cognitive functions than they thought i know that seems the best plan but so many ifs and unknowns and possible mistakes w consequences here we go changing types again i m so done please make sure of your type first before becoming an mbti expert i never was interested in human services i only chose it as a major at my comm college bc they didn t have a psychology major but years ago i was a completely different person heck even yrs ago and yrs from now i will be too and the problem is i can t decide out of the possibilities and i don t like to make a decision until i m sure and i just feel like it will be royally f because i have no idea i have ideas but not one set idea i m not good at setting far plans i feel like i have my current future few months at most planned pretty well under control but i have to make decisions for farther future i just realized it will be at least years before i even start counseling as a licensed mental health counselor i m full of doubts again is it okay that i m not really interested in my human services class but my future goal is to take psych become a counselor still ended better than my trying to drive on the wrong side of the road amp crashing with the little girl in the car"

free of this exhausting fi controlling me and not letting me do things except it both at the same time so i m always controlling myself keeping a tight leash trying to not eat dead birds and you fi have to constantly monitor everything and make sure it isn t going to eat a dead bird or dig up someone garden lol my sister says exactly the same thing for me it more like taking a very boisterous bear sized dog ne for a walk directly contradicts my moral code it always a fight between i have to be good fi and i just want to be alive ne obviously i m biased here but infps can be very paradoxical i often feel like my impulsivity and need for adventure guys thank you for your words they weren t expected and were truly appreciated today was not a good day i made a bad decision that

downsizing policies on climate change whatintends to do will have catastrophic effects worldwide as someone who has a degree in biological science we should not be supporting anyone who thinks global warming is a hoax i m soz for the aggressiveness of this thread but i need to put this out there bc not taking a stand is no longer an option in conclusion please can all trump supporters racists homophobes and misogynists unfollow me if you support him you support his ideals and you support the oppression of millions of people who deserve to be free ignoring the things he himself has said his cabinet consists of people who are sexist racist and homophobic i do not believe thatsupports this mindset and thus i oppose him and his administration i believe that all people should be treated with respect regardless of race gender sexual orient religion or anything else i would rather stand by my beliefs and be shunned than stay silent about things that truly matter to me yesterday i retweeted somethingsaid about not accepting sponsorships from anti lbgt companies i m proud of that ignoring things he himself has said of the people he has appointed many are racist or homophobic i do not condone this i do not believe that thesupports this mindset and therefore i am vehemently opposed to it but i m tired of squashing my beliefs both in real life and on twitter i m tired of trying to keep everyone happy i have something to say in the short time that i ve been here i ve tried to not get political or to offend anyone this made me smile today the song angela terrifies me because it slightly too relatable for comfort and my name is angela my enfp sister is in love for the first time with this hilarious esfj dude and it just the best thing alternate translation don t let your si

leave me feeling sad by the second week of jan i like to choose a word each year to embody i m so much more comfortable giving love than receiving it at around pm mysuddenly sits up and says so i ve been having some thoughts imagine you were blind or a tiny giraffe or if the easiest path is most often not a rewarding one i think to keep living is far more terrifying what would you do if you weren t afraid the people i appreciate the most are the people who teach me how to navigate specific bends in my internal labyrinth that a very good point i defs think that fi users are more likely to cheat bc the morality of it is determined independently but the guilt that accompanied these episodes was suffocating and caused me to call people years after and apologise the ability to decide wht is right and wrong internally combined with the option happy ne is a dangerous recipe and i think that in the future i could possibly justify physical cheating tbh it a big fear of mine at the time i was able to justify it to myself and i think that the way i self defined cheating was very fi and defs beyond the point that you would admit to your so but just not doing anything physcial i have definitely emotionally cheated as in getting very intimate and emotional beyond the point of friendship phew its getting harder to talk in hypotheticals here while i have never physically cheated on someone yes true but overall on average i would still go with ps i wonder if fi or fe would be more likely to cheat to distance yourself if a compromise cannot be reached and i did not get along if someone behaviors are destructive to the people around them regardless of mbti you need i would never exclude or distance someone because mbti simply providing explanations as to why this specific individual i would assume that ps over js are more likely to cheat so life sometimes throws these things at u and u think you re going to die and then u don t and u learn something and u repeat intp

was brought to tears today as i was driving home seeing everyone in their cars slightly convinced that introverts are telepathic and that why we don t involve ourselves with of the people we meet me wanting to be alone is not synonymous with wanting to be away from you so many friendships shattered over this misunderstanding i m haunted by daydreams of what my fullest potential could be had i

why do i only breed words on obscure topics why cant i talk abt the weather w out bringing up global warming i m really bad at being affectionate which makes no sense considering the swarm of

situations just because it in season halfway done w and it been nothing but a challenge i suggest meditation and less social media for those who are empathic like me so handsome p dark circles are a sign of a hardworking or deep thinking individual i talk highly of the moon and poorly of society priorities i m a computer that goes into sleep mode when i m forced to be around people i don t vibe with note to self if i don t dislike you then i probably love you and vice versa because there no gray area when it comes to who i spend my time on why are u crying ur thinking way too much into things have u figured out your life plan yet aw u should smile more i made a blog about humanity and i hope it goes nowhere so i ll keep being honest when i grow tired of fantasizing about my future i switch gears and fantasize about my next existence i m a type which basically means i m the personification of an everlasting sigh if there a way to have extremely low self esteem but somehow manage to be self absorbed i ve figured it out i m good at pretending to be a socialite when i have to be but that doesn t mean my insides aren t screaming runnnnnnn how did i end up with one of the most socially up in your face jobs on the planet how have i survived am i even alive when you re hanging out with someone and they go i invited a couple friends to come too if that cool i wish and wish and wish for something but when the opportunity is finally handed to me i feel like i m being suffocated telling me to stop overanalyzing will actually have the opposite effect because you re basically announcing one of my insecurities i love you so because you balance me out in the most natural of ways caution strangers i will read you and determine my feelings for you and predict your future all within our second encounter i fell in love and it tops my list of the most melodramatic things i ve done thus far a majority of my friendships relationships are long distance and i wonder if i meant for it to be this way from the beginning i enjoy the simple things in life but i ll never live a simple life masochism avoid tomorrow by staying up as late as possible resulting in less sleep amp making the day more unbearable than originally some days it near impossible for me to get words out no matter how active my brain is and let me tell you it one of those days doesn t communicate doesn t get what i want it not my fault you didn t pick up on my signals i made them very clear this time my tweets will eventually contradict each other as a reflection of my actual mind forever in a state of guilt for things happening on other continents to people i don t know waits so many days to return someone call that i have to fake a story about how i left my phone on the moon and just got it back oh please excuse the crystal ball in my brain idk how i ve survived this complex of being if i don t feel a magnetic pull towards you from the beginning don t get excited about the fate of our acquaintance the i actually stands for indecisive when someone mentions myers briggs at a social gathering learning to shed the outer layers that aren t needed and go back to the purest form of me my love for people cannot be contained in the realms of technology in other words sorry i didn t text back again if not careful falling in love means fading away i am erratic in the calmest way possible

pretty stable and good it only shows how crazy and obsessed she really was is it been a long time and their story is pretty much bad so that she can keep pictures and moments of themselves i d really appreciate if my boyfriend ex deleted the pictures she has with him of her instagram account that need you have of going home because there is your shelter god help me trying to make her see one day she screams and uses acid words and won t it ever change because she thinks it ok to be like this and she ll never get how to treat people that what hurting me right now its my sister and it doesn t matter how hard i try she ll never get it it hurts knowing that i can t put it into words too the way she uses words that cut like knives it hurts they never keep it inside as i do they just let go but god it still here surrounding my thoughts they never feel guilty they never feel it hitting our soul they never apologize they never feel like they re wrong i feel impotence because they can t feel what i feel they will never do it so frustrating when people don t see our point of view and turn it around to make it look bad i feel like i wanna cry and it has a long time i don t feel like this and push down the ones we care about in order to make us feel something and i feel i feel so bad try to make me look like a loser and to make them feel better they push us down i feel so overwhelmed it so stressing when people don t comprehend me and worse and write i should write to get this out of my chest it poisoning it self destructing what im feeling now is one of those moments where you have to stop and take a deep breath whatever i can t put it into words and ended in the most cliche way just because again they couldn t show the emotion the moment brought instead they threw us a sequence of individual scenes that weren t connecting well because the best bond would be the emotion at least or like that how much trauma they all had acquired people just watching the movie should see this too and feel it how i felt reading the book they lost pretty important people and killed others as well they couldn t show how in panic she was her head got severely damaged after the war as it is common as a side effect of a war but they really missed the psychological atmosphere the story involves which is what got me i guess they reproduced the actions scenes pretty well better than what i thought and imagined i ve just watched mockingjay part ii and well i ve read the book so of course i have some objections about it thanks for all the gifts you ve been giving me what an amazing day thanks god thanks thanks thanks nocaute well i love the love of my life i never imagined i could be this happy with someone aaaaaaaaaaaah it hurts it frightens me i fell in love fuck now true he got minutes to see me so i can leave it doesn t mean im not shaking i got closer cuz the more i look ridiculous better that why i don t care i ll never have contact with any of these people again it doesn t matter how ridiculous i look i ll never be as ridiculous as he is standing in front of the person that destroyed my world thinking the best thing to do i m the kind of person that gets home and stays a long time inside the car just to be alone for some minutes with no one bothering me can t let go pain splattered teardrops on my shirt god please make it stop i m screaming internally why do i do this to me psychopath he insists on coming and going and disappearing then coming back everything all over again it destroys me if you re gone just don t come back you piece of shit guess god protecting me from doing shit to my life i d rather think this is god speaking and putting things in order hope so cuz i m done with this history everything so fucking confusing specially bc he practically said that all he wanted was to fool me again i mean it what he meant so i get melancholic thinking about all of this because they keep you wondering how things would be if it wasn t for this and for that things like that and i know he maybe a psychopath or a pathological liar but the doubt the maybe kills me and then it came back like a wave bc he came back and turned my world around all over again you know the worst of it all is that i d already forgotten i was over it he not a normal person hasn t stopped lying or anything like that today all i want to do is stay in this melancholic state until sadness goes away they re not half crazy as i am to understand my behavior and all they know doing is judging i m not feeling ok and i can t tell anyone about it cuz it about dealing with someone nobody want to know about how i wish i could go to a solitary beach to reload my energies and think it hurting again i cannot believe you wanted to fool me again the thing is that u re not that person i thought i knew and nothing gonna change that nothing gonna change you bebe tu mesmo do teu veneno a cruz sagrada seja minha luz não seja o dragão meu guia retira te satanás não me aconselhes coisas vãs é mal que tu me oferece eu tava tão bem pq deus pq por que mais mentiras gotta get out of this laziness biggest comfort zone i ve ever been stuck in how can i make

far along are you banner crew what your eta best friends of today y all it son the radio it lit i heard on i d like to talk to these women as ai d love to talk w you on what other violent act would u say u have give of your personal resources have a valid opinion on it whether i am able house homeless my home would have absolutely bearing on my desire end homelessness i plan to foster adopt soon but would a different answer make my desire to end violence null amp void no i will be on msnbc during their am news hour tomorrow talking the women march we also support privacy and the right to make choices with one body but the preborn child has those inherent rights too see the th amendment doesn t trump the rights of other humans to live lethal violence is contrary to all rights bodily autonomy is limited we do not have the right to do violence to other human beings imagine if advocates against human trafficking rape culture war were told mind their own business every time they spoke against violence also i think it contrary to human constitutional rights to harm or hurt them why is this controversial it not from a prolife website i have a friend in medical school and i ve seen the embryology texts lol got it i will try to find it i encourage u to read textbook like the developing human clinically oriented embryology human life starts fertilization original not welcome if unwanted pro life feminists fight discrimination at women march not seeing that a human being is a human being doesn t make violence against that human acceptable lol yeah it was not my original title they didn t even run it by me obviously clickbait thanks for editing it was my pleasure rude boi honestly i might be most honored byandcalling me their friends than anything else i eileen i d ask you to consider no human being should be excluded from human rights abortion deprives preborn hum thank you our voices against misogyny xenophobia hate and violence need to be amplified now more than ever thank you for your kind words and well wishes hoping everyone stays safe and that our voices against misogyny amp ha original title not welcome if unwanted fight discrimination at women march title change thank you patty i believe the future ofisand the future of feminist is prolife ew not my goal my goal is to end violence against humans trump does not represent me and my consistently pro life views i support common sense gun regulations yes may i inquire what species you believe the fetus is in a woman pregnancy human fetus human offspring child i support the right tochoices incl healthcare choices abortion kills a human so it categorically out your condescension indicates an unwillingness to engage my arguments amp is rather paternalistic good day sir also i must remark on how incredibly ableist amp ageist it is to declare preborn human beings unworthy of rights swhen science improves amp viability moves to days after conception what will your position be just curious so what stage in development are you talking at least from prior polling more women are prolife than men i would love to see the most recent data too viability changes based on location in time amp space are we going to base human rights on where when you live we humans are all clumps of tissue at different stages of development your language is meant to dehumanize the human being goes through stages of development ages embryo fetus neonate infant toddler etc etc believe it or not it on my list of things i oppose along withand idk what kind of textbook you had in th grade bio but mine said that human parents create human offspring it not a belief it facts saying a human fetus isn t a human being is like saying the earth is flat definition from multiple dictionaries a member of the species homo sapiens the pre born obviously fit interesting successful abortion always kills a defenseless child literally of the time we are still going andare still going to representand the we should not keep a form of violence legal just because people might do it anyway we should protect all humans please read a biology textbook like the developing human clinically oriented embryology thx absolutely me right now i direct you to the developing human clinically oriented embryology to learn about human development i would like you to tell me why you think it an opinion a product of a same species fertilization is a member of same species that i e human beings make human beings hey there any word on the oped especially pertinent due to the way this is all blowing up either all humans deserve to live w o violence or none of us do injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere mlkjr absolutely not the death penalty is contrary to inherent human dignity what sorry i didn t comprehend your tweet clarify please i support and advocate for restorative models of justice plz look it up thx"

"86","infp","diplomat","lol never this is how you eat a chocolate chip cookie you eat around the chocolate chips cuz they re gross but the cookie p whatever you have you re expected to make more of it and what you lack is no excuse for not doing so preach blake sometimes a person behavior apologizes before their mouth does that means everything when a person has learned their lesson be quiet don t continue to drive the conviction in say no more about it ppl resent the lord mercy to u bcz they want u to pay for what uv done but i thank god that he is not like men and i thank him for jesus the more you understand god ways the less you resent the disadvantages in your life they are all part of the plan some people know the word of god so well that they can speak it in any language why are you looking among the dead for someone who is alive the lord does not judge us as men do he sees the things we don t everybody not meant to see you if some people weren t blind you wouldn t be able to handle the attention you d get its people out there eyes wide open looking for what you got and you re wasting your time doing sign language to a blind person and if you really are great and someone can t see it move along even if you manage to pry open blind eyes you still can t make them see greatness need not announce itself i m turned off by people who try to sell me on how great they are if it is true i will see it whether they tell me or not there is a certain type of person that i complement very well and i find myself most attracted to that type but t every word you say to someone makes a difference every idle word and for all of them we each will give an account the lies you believe about yourself will send you down the wrong path if you don t constantly replace the lies with truth family i don t know how jesus did it i m tired you begin to think differently approve of good things and reject evil and your behavior changes after the pattern of your new thoughts you feed the maturation of the new nature by reading the word of god until your mind and thought patterns begin to change to reflect his salvation is not behavior modification or an act you put on to know how to mingle with christians it a new nature altogether there no way you can be prepared for everything you have to condition ur character to be able to respond well to things you don t expect jesus christ came to save sinners you can have perfect theology but if you have no love your theology is imperfect no matter how hard they try a person cannot be someone that it is not in them to be if you don t let people grow and change you ll lose them if you walk with christ and the people closest to you aren t committed to daily walking in the spirit you will catch it when it comes to spiritual warfare satan loves to empower the people who can shoot at you from close range spiritual warfare is a real and expected part of ministry but the most unexpected part for me is always who the darts come from corinthians says that love keeps no record of wrongs but there no prohibition against remembering the good if the answers to certain questions are irrelevant i try not to ask those questions when i have a strange dream it so hard for me to go back to sleep the lord leading in your life will likely have absolutely nothing to do with what practical the just shall live by faith i have a tv and for the life of me i can t figure out how to work it for anything other than youtube sermons even my tv is saved nobody goes out and looks for what they already have when u only appreciate something when u fear losing it what u really appreciate is ur own comfort not the person or thing you may lose when you re willing to bless people without regard for what you ll get out of it yourself their blessings tend to spill over onto you a good man steps are ordered nothing just happens those first invited to the wedding banquet were too busy and weren t interested the king filled the wedding hall anyways the lord offers you many blessings but he won t force you to accept them the lord often hides his greatest gifts inside what seems undesirable to repel superficial people who won t appreciate the blessing anyway true you just diagnosed my whole life you know the deal being talked to death as usual lol the real question is what is being done to this truth right here lol praaaaaay for me if agreement from others is what you need before you can follow the lord leading you might as well stay right where you are ppl won t understand why u do what u do because they don t understand that you know things they don t you follow the lord they ll learn people want you to move and act according to what they know but if the lord has caused you to know better he expects you to do better people always come back months and years later to say that they now see how right you were but you will have missed your opportunity if the lord has made a thing known to you act according and don t postpone your obedience to wait for other people agreement jesus mt you testify against urselves that ur the descendants of those who murdered the prophets go ahead then amp complete what ur ancestors started peut être i really can t function after pm anymore i plan my whole day just so i can get in bed as early as possible love you sis even if a person is an atheist or whether it the idol of power money knowledge or some other ideal still satan is being worshiped i don t think i have an actual account but maybe i do lol idk it tough being a soft person in a hard place if you make your appeal to righteousness based on how you keep the law you must be perfect we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of christ paul if your spending increases every time your money increases what have you gained there abundance in living a modest life you will have so much more when you don t chase things you don t need you are in error because you neither know the scriptures nor the power of god happy birthday what goes into someone mouth does not defile them but what comes out of their mouth that is what defiles them jesus matthew"
