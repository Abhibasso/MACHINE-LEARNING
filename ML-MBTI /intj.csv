everyone brings something to the table don t be dismissive of people unfortunately the military is the military and she missed out on one of those special fet teams because she wasn t an officer there are very few pashtun cultural experts in the us and even fewer physically fit enough to wear body armor and walk in the mts we need more people like him for instance would have been excellent to have in afghanistan the kicker he a muslim and he often avoids the issue of asked people asked about his halal mre it a religious thing he says he is so effective in locating terrorists and advising he

tonight and if i remember correctly read it in he drew a hot tub on the flight deck or something i like how in your father book they ask him to draw a picture of a carrier ok point taken on that oh yeah reason i bring up algeria is because of fln tactics read more in savage war of peace okay enough talk gym time in short islamophobia will only backfire and fuel extremism daesh can point at the us and say we were right even though muslims are not monolithic they come from all over the world overreach like muslim bans or islampphobia in the us draws recruits to their cause daesh does not want muslims to assimilate in us even though in iraq and syria it mostly other muslims taking the fight to daesh in the case of al qaeda and daesh they want the us to view this as a clash of civilizations west vs islam they try to push the moderates to either side they try to provoke a reaction that causes the powerful to overreach they cause division revolutionaries hate moderates because moderates look for reasoned peaceful solutions i ve been studying insurgency for the better part of years do you know what militant groups really love let look at algeria in that not even the most awesome a oxcart ftw strategists from napoleon to mattis agree torture doesn t work via not gonna lie i totally drink lacroix to read mexico matters fromin ah the good old days when we worked alongside our mexican partners via that sounds great but we have a perfect track record of predicting future threats perfectly wrong hidden in there is talk of how the army lowered standards did not chapter enough troops etc then if you can find it the chiarelli report on army suicides circa i think i saved on google docs also a few links to read first this parts links at bottom we pick a strategy that fits the prevailing political financial landscape not the other way around we like to think we align ways and means to meet ends but in practice it the other way around just like in the late when we thought we could get away with precision weapons air power sof etc better thinking is always a good thing but you simply can t replace people that easily like now there are promotion rates in the low for ltc so basically the post officers but i think the net result of say was positive beyond that it got very dicey we still have long lead times for simple chapters multiple pt test failure takes a year to enforce began holding company commanders accountable for enforcing standards lower level commanders in theset the tone it needed to raise standards and it had x duis and no chapter paperwork was initiated so blame goes to both the army but also actually when he was usareur commander drilled down and found many soldiers who then in those chapters rose again as the army started to crack down again obesity etc chapters for height weight and pt test failure plummeted in by appx in net result was it made it much harder to separate a soldier for misconduct pt failure i have plenty of charts sitting around on my computer but basically the army issued a message in general but pt was one of them perhaps k but organization of the active force matters as well armor infantry medium bigger than the army of k smaller than the k of the war when there were problems also sounds like yoda speak object subject verb i think around k i think correctable to also prk surgery"

countries list please add here instead of sendi i refuse to accept that as food focusing on healing being there for friends and being productive at school work this weekend only sporadically on twitter not on dms samesies same tears of relief step show that bias is still a legit problem and not something we cite b c we are over sensitive check you forgot troublemaker and overly sensitive and emotional bias was always there now it just socially acceptable lt hugs back gt it was much harder to fight an invisible enemy people telling you we ve made progress and it the st century well at least no one will tell us now that there is no bias against immigrants women colored etc the glass ceili already happened to multiple people multiple times i d look up links but i m drained af and have an assignment deadline if foreign and want to visit us you ll end up on multiple lists if really unlucky one of those lists will land you in gtmo yes and thankfully i wasn t around for that abomination but no way to avoid giving biometric data to usgov if you want entry yes please let me know when it up thanks they have my fingerprints medical history work history financial history and my imaginary pink pet rat favorite toy for all i know friend in washington tells me this is how i d end up on lists but bruh i ended up on a list the moment i came to this country yup started by a friend of friend so already circulated in my network thought this was petition against the order trump already signed today you still look young and innocent maybeorororshould write about this if you know any company university that wants iranian or non us citizens please pass on leads editorial where as i said am just a nobody don t think anyone wants me to write an editorial just trying to help friends someone paralyzed w stress apply to university in nonuscountry doesn t help professor in university wants you email them helps am just a nobody doing what i can in a small capacity if you re in a better position to help please help people futures are at stake apply to a university in nonuscountry vs this prof in this university in this country is looking for phd candidates write to them and i passed them on to my friends now they are not nonfunctional they re taking actions to continue their education career some nice people who saw my earlier post regd friends at dartmouth offered me leads on universities companies they could apply to and i know a few others so yes stop telling me not to overreact this is not called being political this is c yeah i actually told some of my friends to look into phd programs in canada might send some your way for info advice yup fortunately canadian friends are giving me details passing them on to my iranian friends we re all living a nightmare honestly not exaggerating when i say we re all emotionally drained and scared he legitimized hate and bigotry when bush and cheney seem like reasonable rational individuals bruh i just saw this under foreign policy i think i really wantright now same feels when i saw that term still can t wrap my head around the many many ways they promoting hate yeah and also bigotry is bigotry no matter how euphemistically one puts it this we can try to pretend that our little field is immune but when politics becomes hostile to science it affe same difference senpai see something that bad and make it not bad lt shrug gt to everyone saying that twitter activism achieves nothing here you go sometimes nice things happen in a shitty i am being reminded of this tweet over and over again the past days prof and almost everyone except people in the group us citizens but they feel ecosystem not conducive so want to move the agenda was to discuss whether people had family obligations etc in the us and whether they d be open to moving out of us yeah i think i m still in shock denial hasn t sunk yet that wasn t empty talk friend research group had a meeting today i ve been tweeting as and when i m seeing hearing things i just saw the progression of this thread in its entirety and shit general sentiment they don t want science they discriminate us we re smart and others want us let just go elsewhere and work in peace this is not one isolated professor serious talks going on b w advisors and phd students to move out of us i honestly can t process this if you dec it the policy of the us government to deport my phd students then deport me first scott aaronson precisely why i m afraid goal here is to show that n is a large number so they have an agenda to unfairly accuse prosecute yeah they are in the middle of their programs course credits not always transferrable tuition living expenses loss etc i feel that i have it less shitty not from iran but when friend called me crying asking what to do it broke my heart it is honestly disappointing that it has come to this awww the feeling is mutual it is always good to meet more experienced women in the field and learn from them can relate to this situation more than you d imagine i don t know about others but my friends were worried about visas being revoked and or being denied re entry if they leave etc told advisor today i was scared about my visa status don t worry we ll protect you wouldn t be functional now if he hadn t said that"

might want to be treated which is with alone time in seriousness i think i m emphatic but not necessary sympathetic this is how nts comfort people in emotional need intj agrees i found a story on fowl energy a city used chicken poop to power their energy grid i used to identify as intx because i was always between j p over time i am definitely j or at least that what i think heaven or hell is what we make in this reality not an esoteric place used as a reward punishment for what we do in this life fantastic site spent the past hour reading random articles one thing i am curious about is what your mbti thanks if you had the time of your life i hope you didn t put that baby in a corner double dirty dancing reference i hear you i value all my relationships but want to add nt to diversify my quality of interactions maybe intps are less noticeable because they are in the corner analyzing while entps are center stage arguing i find entps detectable too when they re around but profession wise i rarely encounter them maybe it easier for nts to blend into the sensor world and nfs stand out more and are more detectable statistically there should be enough of us out there but we can t find each other there needs to be an nt public directory book i m searching for nts but they are elusive i can find nfs at every street corner it appears maybe nts can t detect other nts as easily after seeing the last one i can relate it seems more like a part made for tv episode and not a feature film i have only met a female intj and entp in real life i have yet to meet an intp each time really isn t that different from any other the haziness of the past allows us to forget the present isn t all that different watching tv programming from a time is a glimpse into the collective pop culture hopes dreams fears and determination of an era watching american tv programming over the past week common themes doomsday by h bomb going to space and playing cards at friends on my account i

during transition of accounts between incoming and outgoing accounts twitter bug anyone that ever followed and unfollowed the account historically was someone re followed the arrow and the song by henry wadsworth longfellow it interesting when an analysis of a line poem is pages in length i m watching movies from the with actors born in the that people born years ago and i can see them walking and talking better or worse are relative i m sure in they thought i the pop culture of was odd i spent hours yesterday listening to an aqua playlist good times i liked the tune to cartoon heroes yeah it like meeting another fellow endangered species that happens to also collect stamps or vintage victorian hats i think over of intjs fall into subtypes and w are definitely a highly representative sub type of the the invisible hand gives you a high five xp anything that exists only exists as the culmination of all of the causes and conditions that make that thing exist the shadow of the thing is not the same as the thing itself plato allegory of the cave congrats on that and i m sure you will continue to learn more over time great videos too by the way i have watch many yes it hard to reject the symbols labels and stories of our society in order to find meaning in something deeper i like the thought to take whatever values you have to be a better whatever you are regardless of whatever you happen to be i will take a look thank you or maybe i m lost the functional minimalist is great very short episodes and practical advice she reminds me of you and listening is a requirement to be heard no the original post about if everyone blocked djt on twitter meant no one would hear him most all religions have similar core values that promote humanist values was drawn to the secular view because it doesn t require the buyin of the traditional extrinsic symbols as theistic religion it can be a religion philosophy a psychology some of those things all of those things or none of those things there are many perspectives in buddhism as there are in judisam christianity or islam mindfulness and gratitude have resulted in an awakening like the tint on my glasses has changed the way i perceive the world this is the first time since i can remember to not be happy but free happiness is a result of freedom and not the goal i have a number of degrees great job and all the thing that should make you happy but in fact i was very unhappy this then lead me to read eastern teachings specifically in secular buddhism and view minimalism as a philosophy found fantastic podcast at that lead me to a see a more moderate view as being more practical for my life style in the past month i came across the minimalist documentary which i see as an extreme of the minimalist life style i ll just go gnaw on a tree until i feel better be right back think an orange versus a can of coke both have comparable levels of sugar but very different overall true but natural raw form alternatives are generally safer than human made chemical compounds aspirin and several other compounds are grandfathered and if discovered today would never pass fda trials easily yes safer probably not in order to be heard one has to listen it like the old if a tree falls in the woods saying you need to see this movie it sums up your photo well the path to happiness and freedom is not in material objects but has and always has existed within yourself i add a bit of pepper for uptake and add boiling water to make a tea it not too bad but yes in cold water is gross turmeric is a fantastic anti inflammatory teaspoons has the medicinal effect of regular strength aspirin when i m around other cats my cat can tell and she knows i ve been cheating in a class of your own without
