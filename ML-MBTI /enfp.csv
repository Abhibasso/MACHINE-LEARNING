let alone remember what we resolved to do to absorb the energy of all those i know and love is completely and utterly exhausting my idea of cleaning is more of a gathering amp dumping of piles from many rooms into designated hidden areas i often fill others lives with positive affirmations while trying to quiet the internal chatter in my head of negative insecurities i ll politely smile when you show me the polished surface of your life amp soon i ll be asking about the dustiest corners of your reality enfps can t balance their checkbooks very well but they can balance the emotions of about close friends at the same time not i want people to connect with me but i also need time away love me love my space what a peaceful day it would be to blindfold myself from seeing all sides of every problem every feeling and every outcome if you re an enfp there a good chance someone has lied to you about the actual time something starts just to get you there on time it not that enfps are never running early it just that when we are we feel like we have time to do something on the way then we re late an enfp ability to sum up a situation correctly in a short amount of time is sometimes even shocking to them at work enfps can often be the go to for those seeking support amp empathy be wary of energy consumed from being an emotional dumping ground checks phone messages work related from friend saying do you have time to talk no question which one i respond to first enfps can feel overextended when their drive amp energy creates a leadership role but their preference is to be equal amp explore together enfps search for perfect gifts a gift card just seems too impersonal then we take forever deciding run out of time amp buy a gift card to reveal so much of my soul that others always see the real me my ultimate goal and my ultimate fear enfps try so hard to make the best holiday for everyone else it is our joy but should not be at the expense of our own enjoyment i can make a decision quickly if it involves various paths it easily changed amp i can go back if i don t like it enfps spend a lot of time living life and then recovering from life enfps are never just hearing the words you say we are connecting the subtleties behind the words amp searching for how you really feel journeys are much more interesting to me than conclusions laundry istj finds an unmatched sock searches for where it may be enfp adds single socks to previous pile in room finds a match enfp in public enfp alone we solve emotional crime scenes on the daily why did he make that face is she sad he seemed disappointed that moment when you say something amp no one responds so you keep explaining what you said but still there silence i hate that moment you either love us for our overly passionate empathic nature or hate us for our overly passionate empathic nature enfps are quite the perceptive personality we see through so many defense mechanisms amp passive aggressive ways that it difficult to trust amazing how a quiet morning recharges this extrovert i bounce off the energy of others so much it refreshing to be still enfps can disappear from your life when trying to juggle too many things at once we constantly shift our priorities so we ll be back soon enfps can benefit from a temporary flexible volunteer job helping others is usually the best thing for our self esteem i often give energy to something and crash with energy left things are rarely with me forever editing my wordiness of emotions when composing work emails me daily i once apologized for my messy house by blaming it on my p ness strangest looks ever an enfp can be so lost in a good conversation they will often jolt up in a panic saying wait what time is it i totally forgot to looking in the cushions of the couch for the remote you just lost and finding the cordless phone you lost months ago probs because i never make firm plans for the day my day can be quickly consumed by those who do this i wait to see how i feel about so many things before i make a decision that it overwhelms me and i basically never decide i will jump through hoops to help a friend but show me an online return policy with steps and i won t take the time to return something this was like free therapy i can tell you anything chances are if you are an enfp you ve heard this more than once i am exhausted after a social event because i m constantly assessing how things are going what i said how others are reacting etc i get irritated if i have too many things to do in a day yet i start amp not finish many projects at a time enfps don t excel at short conversations we will walk back to a conversation with one more thing i forgot to tell you over amp over again enfp in a group text friend hi friend hello friend hi me texting privately everything ok how are you really doing i have such a hard time turning people down that my no often sounds like a maybe it hard to have something you love about your personality reflected back as too sensitive or dramatic as an enfp i m so happy you like what i have to say i read negative meaning into words that are not extreme if you say fine ok or yeah i will assume something not quite right i have a silent project wave challenge going on w my neighbors it is my goal to get them to wave back don t just agree with me to agree with me i want you to passionately reflect on things i say amp challenge me to see things in a new way if we are talking with someone who has nothing in common with us enfps start to dig we will use humor or insight to find a common ground enfps do buy birthday cards we just put them aside until we can add a meaningful note then forget to send them intuitive people watching i m always finishing big projects myself because i don t want to put people out or don t plan far enough in advance to ask for help you are right when it comes to brainstorming about what could be i do that but am very bad at planning amp organizing ahead enfps are good at living in the moment we forget too much to live in the past amp we re often too unorganized to focus far into the future because we are able to read what people need enfps usually

"51","enfp","diplomat","how is trump admin oppressing muslims obama did not allow iraqi refugees for months in it definitely an issue that needs to be addressed that a great question for obama he needs to get on that too you do realize that claim is baseless right he hired jewish people to work at breitbart i always remind people of this image right here gt i really think this is one of the reasons he ran for president he hates seeing discord in his community beyond many ny families white black hispanic and asian have had to give up the pleasure of a leisurely stroll in the park have u seen his plan for urban renewal here obama admitting that voter fraud exists who do you think would be qualified then did you think obama pick julian castro was that wrong but in this letter i see trump screaming out for peace in his ny community the importance of law enforcem yep me too yep carson had a rough childhood yes lived in urban detroit boston he understands the struggles of the inner city this is also a really great thing he did that main stream media refuses to report on he said some things he shouldn t have his actions say otherwise though when dealing w people that also why he appointed dr ben carson to house amp urban development he wants these communities to thrive that a noble thing for a president to act on it unacceptable that many in poor communities are getting shot he kept saying over and over how horrible it is that people are getting shot while walking to grab a loaf of bread he compelled to act in chicago because of how out of hand it is if anything he wants it to stop did u c abc interview again not defending him but just pointing out this is how he talks weird no no he not a christian and he wasn t making fun of the disabled reporter i agree i can t defend his behavior he has not behaved well but i think he hates the fact the so many in chi are getting killed what do you mean by defending justice i only ask because people give it different meaning he not a christian but he is for christian values such as being pro life he is not the racist people peg him to be whoa father let him appoint an unbiased judge devoted to adhering to the constitution no one should believe everything anyone says i m gonna be one of trump harshest critics thanks for sharing it think about all the reports about voting machines not working owned by george soros who wants to destroy the us you have to keep an open mind i wanted dr ben carson as prez but he dropped out this is why we have the electoral college california ny have millions more people who vote dem voter fraud affects both republicans and democrats no one wants a president who won by cheating same thing w state officials here a news article in colorado about it what biased about going undercover hearing people in their own words that not biased so the people were lying i can link to a whole lot more from other states but i think you get the point another dnc official confirming voter fraud more voter fraud with election officials breaking election laws i can just point to videos and news articles there have been many documented cases of democrats registering dead people to vote and so on drink that tart cherry juice why do say it as if it didn t happen evidence shows it happened and even obama encouraged illegals to vote founder margaret sander said the most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it obama is most definitely not a christian you re saying that what should be truth on the matter is from cultural background experience that not true so what are you saying the gender norm understanding is for an a a well but race is not the issue gender norms apply to all people regardless of race read the article but not sure how that answers my questions and how is that phrase exclusive to conservative white middle class gender norms has nothing to do w race ok but to call it racially coded really is that a hair magazine isn t biblical manhood and womanhood what we should aspire to how is that phrasing racially coded actually our chief goal is to glorify god if that not first then your marriage and family will suffer plead the promises of god like jacob here the link i posted them all onyou can get all as a bundle i plan on making more too obama is wayyy more of a threat to our democracy than trump love your show dave keep up the good work why yes i am that an exact quote and how do u know i ve not read it interesting only through god kindness that leads us to repentance i guess no telling how widespread though only god knows seems like revival is often coupled w resurgence of sharing gospel what do you think a revival would look like in our generation i can think of some things but how widespread this is so sad who do you think is doing the bombing but chuck this is exactly in line with obama political and religious worldview"
