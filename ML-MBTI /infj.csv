"2","infj","diplomat","its not like they have proper living conditions threw out the muslim world for so many yes to just call in sick take a sick day off from work feb lefties leaving out critical explanations why so many muslim immigrants coming to the usa its not all about liberty freedom agreed muslim countries are encouraging making as many babies as possible its a muslim immigration invasion many atheists deists have been martyred in saudi arabia for being atheists lets do a my main reasons for banning saudi there wahhabism teachings threw outthere region treating women like second citizens the left needto increase votes on the ground but a largerpicture muslim immigration is a strategic invasion of the usa i would prefer to just ban saudi arabia but gong by the numbers of muslim immigration is it truly usa problem muslim immigration is filled with propaganda by the left nothing to do what going on as larger picture of world affairs its muslim immigration invasion due to muslim countries making to many babies not the usa problem or tellthose muslim countries stop having so many babies sounds about right from what i observed this past year lol i don t see myself returning to my old easy going ways because of last years one sided pandering beginning in march usurping laws are becoming the norm over the people and lands i fully support anot a since in saudi they murder atheists and secularists that terrorism even drug addicts are in love with certain types of drugs not much difference in addictive relationships plus iran and other muslim countries make way to many babies on purpose its a strategy soros saudi arabia muslim nations wants to destroy the usa i have but not becoming that person that is a addictive person with a little erratic behavior i don t talk about it as well when your getting high around one person and when not around that person you become low that addictive behavior with toxic i agree i don t get off on being setup around hotties more so wanting to prove a point but yes i do flirt but not as much muslim immigration into the usa is a strategic move to destroy the republic its not about freedom and liberty muslim countries that encourage making more babies so to increase muslim immigration to the west usa that why hey whatz happening duddette the best way is stop over thinking issues causes worries then causes anxieties eat chocolate and ice cream instead watch movie be strong belief in yourself and don t allow others to influence into bad addictive behaviors addictive traits can be controlled otherwise a future of addictive behavior relationships is the horizon i do understand but the fantasy or ideal change will happen most likely will not happen addictive behavior trait maybe its time to cut away addictive behaviors in you life with them its like they egg you into addictive behaviors is the escape place for escaping from being honest in the moment or escaping toward fantasy ask what type of behavior are you work toward a enlighten behavior in all relationships not addictive behavior why are so many muslim countries paying for the protests in the st place save secularism sounds good what if they even win bigger merv post apocalyptic sci fi short film france is become a islamic state usa needs to resist this since foreign states are aiding this muslim migration be a lot more indians today if there wasn t immigrants at all this nation would be empowered by pagans i wonder how will the stock markets respond to theon monday time for trump to pull out a executive order to ban all toys in the usa they ll just use food and energy gasoline electricity to keep us under control amazing how many shady people are entering the usa right at the moment of the saudi arabia putting out supportthe saudi within the usa are most likely the one funding to incite unrest and protests at thi the ten year cycle of boom to bust is a little overdue just like most of the usa bills are overdue want to send potato and sweet potato to not going to happen to many people stocks for retirement went threw the roof since trump took office money talks those numbers are false its more like we are the and the some of over will be watching the super bowl nextweekend when socializing is like a uphill battle even to just say hi i ll stop all together don t like the feeling of doing something wrong thissupports building that type of wall hottie in a lingerie nightie have a relaxing sleep no science no news no competition science majors in college no science govt gigs for the next to years plus they don t understand personal space especially around women girls i would prefer a chocolate filling with blueberry don t think there made yet not sure of a raspberry filling either i won t doubt saudi students in the usa is funding for inciting violence and protests against muslim ban wolfs in the hen house saudi arabian nationalists inside the usa funding to incite unrest and protests saudi

what to do me i made a bunch of plans on my day off and i kind of want to cancel them infp i understand the feeling i d just use the time to sleep i m so happy to be home just bought me pizza for dinner and gave me a cookie don t tell anyone but entjs do care i m really sorry about that that must have hurt i hope you find your people wherever they might be me so a couple came into work that adopted dogs cats amp horses knowing people like them exist made me happy so i wanted to share it i d like to say this impulse has passed and i m content to stay at home with tea a good book and silence me except i m female but i m looking for a fulfillment that comes no matter where i am or who i am with a reassurance that happiness is reachable because i like the affirmation that comes when i m told i did a good job i like being with people and knowing that it is a safe place i try to make myself available to other people by doing everything right and showing up when they need me and looking to help supposedly the most attractive people are happy that doesn t come naturally to me should i change who i am to be more acceptable to you i m scared of rejection when i show you what a broken and sad human being i am being happy is the hardest thing for me to achieve i m gonna have to find some cake then this is an excellent alternative hahahah that honestly sounds like the safest

tv quotes i found our gif person i have news me tell me all the things sends million messages person it easier to dwell on all the people who didn t try but it better to invest in the good friendships you have now honestly find people who will put effort into the relationship and be willing to stop trying for friendships that aren t reciprocal don t trust the people who don t respond to any texts or ask how you are doing but in person act like you haven t talked in forever beware of the people who will talk to you over social media but won t acknowledge you in person they just want attention not friendship be careful of the acquaintances who unload their and their friends drama on you information about your life will be spread just as easily all of these are me is there such a thing as an accidental genius i literally just want to write short stories about reincarnation now i effing love this me moral of the story of these tweets don t give into perfectionism have friends who remind you you re better than your flaws being a perfectionist means feeling like a fake and that sense of dread as you wait for people to figure that out being a perfectionist means accepting love feels like a chore because you feel the one who loves you don t see all your flaws being a perfectionist means scoring perfectly on a test walking out of the room and feeling like it was a fluke being a perfectionist means a constant state of lowkey anxiety as you try to enjoy the moment while you know what else you could be doing being a perfectionist means trying and if you do well it isn t enough and if you mess it up you re devastated by the smallest mistake one person can make you sad for eternity it up to you to try and move on to better things they would have tried if they wanted to skip the sad song that reminds you of them take a walk instead of refreshing social media for their status update take care of yourself ever get a bad vibe after meeting someone yeah me too they ve all had wicked senses of humor held interesting conversations and i ve usually helped out when they forgot or didn t plan i ll observe and try to confirm my typing as the semester goes on if he is i have a pattern and it makes me laugh enxps are great being forgetful applies to every type but the enfp and entp i became friends with last semester acted very similarly to this guy he was five minutes late to class forgot his pencil asked for a sip of my water because he needed some to take his pills tentatively typing one of my classmates as an enfp my theory is i find an enxp every semester or they

"7","infj","diplomat","when you know what people are going to ask before they ask what are some of your favorite different topics to talk about mine are the night the water eyes and my infj journey of course sometimes i wonder if my love is meant to cast a wide net instead of a single line it doesn t seem designed for depth with one person the feelings of the past never fully fade anniversaries and memories are hard when things aren t what they once were thinking about what used to be and what no longer is and what can never be don t think i ve ever taken it anyone ever feel like they don t belong anywhere or with anyone when you reach out to someone to help make a huge life decision and you re painfully reminded you can t count on anyone thank you love is an action even if we don t receive it as much as we would like we need to give it all the more being mentored in one conversation and mentoring someone in another conversation that how it should be i don t know hopefully but doubtful when you embarrass yourself in front of your crush something i ve learned my feelings about people are not dependent on their feelings for me i can like someone even if they don t like me of the hardest things is seeing the potential u have w someone but life prevents u from making a connection w them amp you re left to wonder is it too much to ask someone to think of me be there for me to see me as a person we want god to provide more so that we need to rely on him less how sad is that something i said led someone else to do an act of kindness for a random stranger the change of seasons can be a powerful thing so many people are on my mind at the end of the day i wonder if any of them think of me when our voices our drowned out by the shouts of those we call friends people tend to want to talk at you more than they want to talk with you i m searching for a world that does not yet exist these are the times when you really figure out who cares no matter who or what it is it obsession or apathy there no in between maybe night becomes so lonely because the stars are so far away when we ve been strong and alone for so long that we can t remember what it like for someone to truly be there for us faint stars faint dreams past few days i ve been humbly reminded on how different i think den the majority of people the heart remembers things long forgotten by the head anyone else feel more alive when the earth awakens and hints of spring arrive in the air most encouraging conversation i ve had in a long time from bible study tonight maybe desiring to follow god is following god they always think of the haves and not those who lack my emotions are so powerful and often distort gods truth i m only one person but i can take on the emotions of everyone around me we thirst for the future and past in our minds and hearts on a brighter note church was great today almost didn t go but as soon as i got there i encounter the loving god another person i know hair got engaged happy for them but would like to be happy for me one day too you know i ve come to believe that shame is the worst of all the emotions the holidays so many emotions i have a different journal for every part of my life and still want more journals in vivid memories in the middle of the night that where i find you that where i find me my wish is that everyone could know the impact their words truly have on those who hear them both good and bad how different would we be stargazing moves me in a way that hard to describe things affect me so much the emotion reaches down to my core love this time of year but trying to find and recapture the magic that just not quite the same as when i was a kid i watched the stars from my window sill the whole world is movie but i m standing still one of those nights tomorrow is a new day and new opportunity to make a difference in the world how many chances am i going to give people stuck between forgiveness and trust so many thoughts in my head at times like these so often i wonder what wrong with me i have desires for so many things i have never known or even properly imagined i think i have more to say to people i see every day than those i haven t seen or talked to in months i have no idea where my life is going but you can be sure i ll over analyze it for days i have all these great date ideas and never get to use them pain is so very real that awful hope there were some bright spots to your day this is a good way to start monday i make decisions constantly which positively affect the people in my life and they ll never know about it because that how i am are we all trying to figure out how to live and missing out on actually living why i am always the one who models for others proper human interactions just once i would like to catch a break when will people learn the relationship has to take priority over the task rule situation i wasn t expecting that hope your day got better today i always get lonely at the end of the night i share in the happiness of others but i want my own happiness too that is how i can be both happy and sad at the same time life experiences at the same time what happens to the friendship can it be as close it has to change as the experience has changed the friends we are closest with are those who we go through life together with sharing experiences but when we are no longer going through"
"8","infj","diplomat","thank you so much i really really appreciate that i m struggling with balance time for myself feels almost nonexistent as of late constantly frazzled and overwhelmed i m lonely but i don t feel particularly like talking to anybody we were talking like we were being real but something was missing another dynamic change i suppose why do i feel like i need to apologize this is the most sad i ve been in a while it hurts do i need to take on less or utilize better coping mechanisms i can t speak my mental exhaustion is taking over me but i miss you and i care about you and i m sorry i m being terrible at showing it when i get to this point thinking about the overwhelming stress does nothing but hurt me i really think the only solution is sleep everything just hit me a longer buildup than usual all the people worries small conversations big frustrations the little things that i could let bother me fade away as i remember we love each other we care for each other we re here for each other i wish i could do more it pains me to see you suffering the way i did not so long ago i m full of questions and i know they will only fully be answered once i act but my nerves always try to find a way to get the best of me my heart has already made my decision but how can i pursue this dream if i don t know where to begin how do i overcome my inhibitions do i dare take the risk for the possibility of a reward that has never been so close i usually don t post specific personal things on here but i got into my top school and i am elated i can t express my exhaustion pretending like it ok when each time my soul crushes a little more i m so so so tired of rejection in every form when will love find me when will i stop missing what feelings are real and what just stem from my adoration of your affection towards me don t continue w the defense that neither candidate is good especially now wake up my heart hurts i m scared for what the future holds and yes i do see your mind trying to change the story to benefit you and your ego let not play games and instead lets own up to what we both did and felt hard yes worth it absolutely want to talk honestly we both equally played a part that what a relationship is or should be flattery isnt a part of this honesty is why did you act like it meant nothing to you like you didn t even play a part don t boost your ego thinking i m desperate just because i if i m having trouble placing feelings of intense frustration it time to spend some serious time alone oh how nice that feels i think the best thing to do is just sit with myself for a little bit away from it all but there is a point when it not healthy and you know it time to let go and give yourself some space here i am back to being frustrated by you then feeling guilty and then feeling unsure where to go round goes the cycle i m sorry don t say sorry so much sorry hyper focusing again i ve come to accept rationally that relationships change in ways that aren t always easy emotionally i m not sure i ve gotten there don t think for a second that i won t carry on without you as a fantasy i wouldn t want you so deeply misled i ll repeat it until it becomes true i know what i m worth certain situations other people perceptions responses i won t let these alter the love i feel for myself having an irrational expectation that the person i m talking to will say what i want to hear and help me reach a conclusion the way i need processing happens best for me when i m alone while talking can help it can also end up making me feel more frustrated because i end up realizing a lot of my frustration stems from my inability to act how i want to without feeling a sense of guilt and need to justify i think they more felt the need to conform to the social hierarchy in a group setting when youre gone i see you in every picture i hear you in every song romanticizing something that never felt quite so pure when you were here busy life i live actions become mindless and i quickly forget the importance of my mental health to remember to make time for myself inside me wants to push away the thought and continue being fine how i feel i m expected to be it can be so hard to separate from the often times it can take some deep analysis to even fully acknowledge that i m having a rough time although it may seem obvious something there no better time to start loving and embracing dwelling on the negatives is easy but ultimately very hurtful time to focus on what truly matters my brain will not stop working on a problem that doesn t need to be fixed they are probably thinking about it a lot less than you are learning it not impolite to stand up for amp assert myself in situations that make me uncomfortable big or small i can have needs too it been a long week ready to do some refueling and letting go the web of relationships we weave is so delicate transition periods never have been easy for me heavy sigh practicing the art of letting relationships play out and feeling like i don t need to be in constant control you left but this time i m not going running i ll practice my patience to see when you ll come back lately feeling in some ways like my life doesn t feel like my own feeling extremely sensitive to others needs yet so quickly disregarding my own it time i give myself a break slightly changing how you act around me when you re around different people is expected a drastic change that what hurts feeling a deep appreciation for myself and the road on which i ve traveled to arrive where i am today pain and hurt yes but pride and love i think i ll take some time to appreciate the fact that i m feeling very at peace not sure how but i m sure not questioning not everybody will love you not everybody will see your beauty that doesn t make it any less yours there always been a weird tension not sure how to label it so i won t but i d be lying if i said it didn t give me an itch once in a while smiling from the heart if you consistently find yourself pointing fingers when conflict arises don t you think it time to step back and evaluate constantly reminding myself that their problems my problems i can care and listen but there are boundaries for my emotional attachment when you are so close with someone it can be hard to lay out boundaries both for the relationship and for yourself i don t mean in terms of growing apart i mean in terms of maintaining friendships and recognizing and defining boundaries it important to feel close to people you ve formed close bonds with what i struggle with sometimes is separating myself from these people the intention often good but viewing anything straying from your definition of normality as an issue is a less than constructive attitude allow people to have situations in their lives without feeling like you need to change or resolve them there not always a problem that needs to be fixed it really turned around that i m apologizing for expressing how i feel why do i keep doing that so i can save you from the real me i asked if you needed space took me long enough to realize it me who needs it beginning to feel more like a burden rather than a person of value whether it all in my head or not is debatable discussion of feelings has been lacking and i feel guilty and bothersome continually initiating it based on responses less than perfect and stressed or upset at times i ve felt like my needs haven t been met in a way they had before an honest it was more along the lines of a connection where both people are aware of the others needs however lately when i ve felt and the most painful thing is i thought we understood each other and now i m seeing otherwise how do you deal with this pain i struggle to emote strong feelings to friends beyond a certain circle finding the limitations and frustrations this brings each day does something slightly risky worries about it for a weeks to months after i ve seen

afraid of being happy we as humans ultimately need to pick a side humanity or eminent destruction i wish it was that simple every so often you meet a random stranger that leave the most lovely imprint amp you never see them again but you re changed for the better does anyone here carry crystals on them and if so what kind am i right lol thanks such a bummer need to start listening to that little voice more bleh didn t listen to my intuition this morning when it told me to transfer my wallet somewhere else gt gt gt wallet got stolen i feel like no man will ever be able to handle my infjness frustrating when they re so tired of you always being right that they would rather lie than for you to be right again can anyone else feel the suffering of humanity of the world i have always loved snow becauseit the only peaceful thing that can stop the world in its tracks and just be still i have a confession sometimes the evil moments are wildly satisfying what are people opinion thoughts on the mandela effect now i m all worried about dying in a solar storm damn being on the treadmill at the gym is forcing me to watch fox news now i m all stressed out i never watch the news and this is why reasons why infjs could rule the world of my favoritearticles i ve ever read it just different that gut wrenching feeling when someone cancels plans with you last min and you repeat to yourself it fine its ok like its your mantra true i just find myself having moments of resentment towards being an infj but i feel its bc of some people in my life after talking to others on here i feel like i have much to learn still and some growing to do i get frustrated with myself do you ever sometimes find yourself wishing you weren t an introvert wow yes that makes sense i never put the two together i feel so tired all of the time no matter how much caffeine i have i actually love the museum idea thank you this when something makes so much sense you can barely formulate words just ughhhhhhhhh you re right which now i realize is also not being in solitude but one problem at a time i guess hm food for thought thank you perhaps i should start turning to friends more to distract me from wanting companionship ok now i don t feel as crazy i love your game plan so brilliant so infj i just keep getting mindlessly drawn to people its hard for me to be alone for a long time will this need for companionship go away w age or practice or am i just odd how do other infjs get themselves out of a funk rm drake is amazing things get really ugly when we use our powers for evil its hard knowing you can t ever fall apart because the thought of the pain it would bring to your loved ones trumps your pain you re right i just feel like i never cease to be amazed at what we can do its so very humbling and heartbreaking at times okay i ve always wondered if i was imagining things but i also always prayed that i was help do any of you infjs find it difficult to stay single agree it refreshing to not have to choose my words so carefully they usually just get it this th extinction thing i knew it i knew i felt funny my whole life something just felt off anyone else my heart cant survive openly and completely as is in this world so in turn i fashion my world and the people in it around my heart i miss the excitement of summer vacation as a child jesus this mercury retrograde really sucks i wish i had more patience i think the whole skipping steps thing has really messed with my patience levels you know in many aspects an infj would make the most kick ass lawyer i must remember to watch the fine line between overbearing and good intentions even tho i think it best it ends up pushing people away never let your infj significant other feel like they re alone in the relationship nothing will break her quite like that feeling i feel weird today is this supermoon effecting anyone else just me that super moon though i just want someone to take care of me for once it just feels so difficult sometimes being with someone plus dealing with this brain of mine w all of its nonstop tinkering when i was a kid too boom yes i just realized you re from seattle too d i agree idk what more difficult that or being with someone extremely opposite of an infj oh hush you from your tweets alone you seem like an amazing person my fear is actually that i will grow tired of them anyone else here weary of marriage just worried about finding someone who is willing be patient w all of your quirks and vice versa i m horrible at re telling a story i stumble over my words and have to back track bc i have a difficult time remembering how it really went same here my thumb never scrolled so fast in fear of seeing a picture of it i can t ever watch videos like that when i try i can actually feel the different seasons each season has it own feel to it neat the lonely phases can be so difficult had an emotional breakdown in front of my friends yesterday and now i m so embarrassed of myself as i replay the night in my head it hilarious how i m always excited for an event outing until the day of and theni m like shit i gotta be around all those people thanks for the follow and can i just say

to know i m slightly more prepared to defend myself in the upcoming armageddon also i think there something to be said for tough workouts releasing a ton of pent up anger and or anxiety ooh i d say they re the same but w a different release of emotions dancing joy exercising anger anxiety it so cathartic to be able to yell and swear and sweat without worrying about what anyone else thinks of you working out alone in my living room is my new favourite thing i ask because i ve been known to misjudge the platonicity of my friendships on occasion platonic on whose side yeah i m hollowing out my usage of it too mostly just use it to follow news outlets journalists and a few artists i think we re seeing democracy at its finest it more than just voting once every few years there is something unnatural about getting into a fb debate with someone i went to high school with like we should ve lost touch years ago this also happens to me all the time in public even brief interactions are so psychologically complex in ways we ll never know awwwww when i hear people say they think everything is going to be fine it strengthens my resolve to fight because it isn t and someone has to being ignorant doesn t keep you safe entp it just a loop don t say that out loud wait did i say that out loud me how many times a day do you say to yourself don t say that out loud entp oh my god constantly it the default anytime feel free to dm you can support insert cause here without having the t shirt that is exactly how i felt in my st and nd year of undergrad keep going you can do this and it does get better cc having voicing opinions does not make you any less nice anyone who equates niceness with silence is a coward stop giving other people control over your ability to make positive life choices for yourself stop waiting for their permission to grow i mean it worth a shot right i can usually talk myself down to having an extra slice of cake with no regrets seriously i m normally more of a letter writer than a marching protester but when push comes to shove soooooooooo many feels today god this makes me so happy laughter is an act of resistance i get that some people have to learn things the hard way but i just don t think it fair to take the rest of the world with them in my experience istjs have some trouble seeing themselves clearly so self tests can be problematic when you re off the beaten path progress is more meaningful but harder won i really like having more autonomy but that means letting go of my old safety nets living and dying by my own sword metaphorically i spent most of my being pretty opportunistic but within a predetermined framework then i threw the whole framework out the window trying to find a balance between actively creating the life i want for myself and loosening my perfectionist tendencies i hold pain physically too maybe try writing things down express yourself in a passive way so that you re not expecting a response this happens to me almost every night too slowly drifting off into a peaceful sleep when my entp gently inquires do you have cankles idealist mom infp and rational dad intj i think i ve always felt loved too but not sure how much i ve ever been heard talking w my parents often feels less like a dialogue and more like them running through a list of things they ve been meaning to tell me it freakishly adorable right my face when non infjs try to understand the doorslam reminds me of this i don t understand your question funny though bc this tweet stemmed from a convo w my infp mom she the same way as you habit is the antithesis of thoughtfulness i strive to make as few things a habit in my life as possible this was the jist of a minute back and forth from a family get together last night intp just imagine this hypothetical situation istj i can t because it doesn t currently exist intp no imagine istj i can t for better or for worse we are each the product of our unique past experiences from prisoner of tehran by marina nemat love had its way of doing things it was like spring crawling into the skin of the earth at the end of winter but i suppose it something that i now have this expanded vocabulary to express what i know about myself even if no one yet listens i would not say i m grateful for having had my identity broken apart and having had to expend so much energy putting it back together recovering from that relationship felt child like discovering my identity once again through exploration and small cautious risks being with a gaslighter first makes you wonder who am i and later do i even exist is any of this real you want to etch these words into your skin to make sure there is some record of this core human identity that you ve been stripped down to i am good i am worthy i am doing my best i will keep going when you finally reach your limit you ll feel empty hollowed out just an endless loop of self affirmations playing in your mind the thing you agreed on yesterday is suddenly a problem today there is never understanding or consistency to a gaslighter you ll never be good enough you ll never be accepted you ll always struggle for stability be surrounded by uncertainty over time this robotic way of thinking destroys your self confidence and any sense of spontaneity but it the only way to survive you had have to be very clear minded and consistent about these things or you would lose all sense of reality the thing about having loved a gaslighter is that you become very good at articulating your thoughts and feelings even if no one hears you although that is for intp infj relationships it applies to us note we met in our late maturity definitely factored in yeah my husband is an entp it works wonderfully for us and also other couples i know a lot like this i have yet to find this limit with my entp which to me is one of his very best qualities ime debates with a te dom aux always end with them abruptly getting offended once you reach the limit of their pre determined thoughts thank you it was a whirlwind but we managed to capture some amazing moments together like this totally has its moments but i d way rather this way than the opposite where you have the details but no real big picture"

for far too long it feels good it allows me to solve problems to find beauty in unexpected places it allows me to forgive and to laugh when all else fails i m thankful i can t imagine not feeling every single little thing deep to my core i see it as more of a blessing than a curse so many feelings floating around not enough time to analyze them all looking beautiful is not the most important thing in the world but feeling beautiful is sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself because i could find no language to describe them in jane austen sense and sensibility it like you pass them and you can tap into their whole aura and you feel them and then they re gone and that all you know of them isn t it so strange to pass people in the street and know that all you ll most likely ever know of them protect your sensitivity but don t ever let the world make you a cold person empathy is truly a magical thing don t ever let anyone make you feel like you re overreacting or overthinking

views in the first place no great mind has ever existed without a touch of madness aristotle sorry for the lack of tweets i ve been a bit busy lately i don t so much dwell in negative emotion like i used to and i feel i m healthy i used to thrive in negativity but now i avoid it that what i was thinking but at my unhealthiest i was so obviously type four but now i feel i m a lot like a nine it makes sense and it fits me very well but i also feel like when i was unhealthy i was so obviously a type four so i don t know i ve always felt i am a healthy type four but i just tested as a type two and now i don t know what to think it is a fire that consumes me but i am the fire jorge luis borges a new refutation of time i m no expert though just passionate if you re an infj and you re not really a feeler that doesn t really make sense i usually suggest either an assertive infj or an intj anyone else ever have issues like this and has anyone ever come across an infj who isn t comfortable with feelings of any kind i m not trying to shame or offend anyone by suggesting that they may be a different type but they usually express conflicted feelings there really no special personality type each type is as meaningful and diverse as the next i can spot a person type so easily it bothers me so bad when people say they re and infj but they re not cause there no closure there so many contradictions everywhere i don t fit but i mingle well but it never the satisfying type of interaction i m only half heard i always say it the four in me since i seem to so easily converse with people but i never feel truly accepted i understand people and relationships so well yet i will never fit in at a party or i ll never have a group of friends and etc i usually never dwell on this too much and i ve gotten over it a long time ago but it still creeps up on me sometimes it frustrates me to no end how i m in the middle of everyone all the time i understand everyone and everything yet i m so outcasted balanced most times not always though and that okay blame that on ni while i so easily understand literally everything i have a hard time explaining why that is or say breaking it down for another person i always feel like i can explain my thoughts and feelings so clearly but actually getting them from my brain and into the world is hard to be mindful is to find hidden beauty in unexpected places i keep my mind focused outwards to get a feel for the things around me then i turn inwards to dissect and analyze what i find and feel those moments are far and few nowadays helping and interacting with others keeps my mind focused outwards but i keep a balance now and that always leads me back to my own mind and my own safe little world the counselor in me tells me i m being self absorbed those times generally i stay pretty sanguine and serene but when i hit a low point i find myself getting rather annoyed and bored by everything i can find talking to be boring cause i know what point someone is trying to make and people always think one thing and say another i m so fully and overly aware of everything that can find reality to be boring i m trying not to think that way so much but at the same time i m fully aware of the differences between my own brain and the outside world what might take me five seconds to say i have contemplated and nit picked about times over in my head i analyze literally everything i forget that things i imagine so vividly haven t really happened or i forget people aren t aware of how much thought i put into things sometimes i forget not everyone is aware of my own inner word since i get lost in it so easily i m never bored or lonely in a way it makes me feel like i have a super power but i also don t want people to feel like i have the upper hand i want us to be equal i tend to know and notice a lot very easily and i notice it can make people quite uncomfortable but that just so naturally me i love to analyze everything and i m not always sure if that good or not it can make me feel quite intrusive please consider me a dream franz kafka it hard to explain in words but i feel like i can now control the flow of emotions that seem to drift to me like my mind is finely tuned i feel like the best version of myself i m active in helping those who come to me and they give me such amazing feedback it feels amazing i m a turbulent infj so this hasn t always been the norm for me but it refreshing i feel i ve really come to understand a lot i feel rather balanced and serene in myself most days even

see every day in kreuzberg and neukölln berlin haven t seen the film yet but the trailer looks amazing can t wait watch alec empire intro music for the rare avant garde film phantomanie from first they invented their own gods anyway your first tweet is something i really agree with hopefully some of my followers read it why that strange i just replied to the angry guy now i have dragged an innocent bystander into this i apologize sorry the angry pro violence added you to make himself appear bigger it felt like two against one at times highly recommended read interview with oliver gillet from mutable instruments nic endo quote of the day what are you doing this weekend which atr songs do you have in your playlist pre order alec empire new album on itunes and that is from the leftist anti semitic handbook especially when you bring up israel one tweet after what you did was you made your tweet sound like i somehow took richard spencer side which is a lie spare us of the my closest friends are anti zionist jews rethoric listen to new alec empire track from his upcoming film score album so this is what you spreading a lie about me was about after all interesting old fashioned jew hatred du rufst öffentlich zur gewalt auf verstehst keinen kontext beim darauf hinweisen reagierst du wie ein schüler it also takes a peanut brain to laugh about heroes like gene sharp that what you just did if you didn t understand what amp me spoke about you shouldn t be an activist and rethink your violent strategy deine tweets zum thema aktivismus amp gewalt sind gefährlich dumm you don t even know what i said but you repeat something false you are part of the problem why the left is losing alec empire speaks about his new album soundtrack for film out on feb rd people hate me too now for having a different opinion on violent protests against the state nobody convinced me so far that is probably why i am not part of what you call your movement if logic truth and reason are abandoned from it wenn deine gewaltstrategien so super aufgehen seit jahrzehnten warum wächst denn das problem hast du gelesen worüber wir gesprochen haben es ging um gewaltfreien aktivismus yes it changed my life my approach to life and it made it better use your mind and reason du meinst wirklich ernsthaft daß deine faust eine besseres tool ist als dein gehirn dein instinkt steht über dem verstand lies meine tweets wenn es nicht klick macht noch klarer sag ich es nicht ich hab wenigstens versucht mit euch na dann viel glück beim stoppen des rechtsruck durch gewalt ich bin nicht dabei hab das hier genau erklärt mal nicht das thema wechseln wir haben über gewaltfreien aktivismus gesprochen doch wenn die linke nicht überzeugen kann was sie anscheinend nicht kann man wird nicht rechtsradikal geboren thank you inspiring text as always ich solidarisiere mich mit niemanden ich bin für mich selbst verantwortlich und mit gewaltstrategen solidarisiere ich mich nicht dann benutze halt gewalt um den rechtsruck in europa zu bekämpfen ich lehne das ab weil es erfolglos sein wird es ist besser mit dem kopf und ideen faschistische ideologien in einer demokratie zu bekämpfen das sage ich ihr meintet ich wäre ein arschloch weil ich das hier mit pete fein getweetet habe dann schau halt nicht mehr zu und beteilige dich ich sage das weil du ja anscheinend gewalt als angemessen findest in dieser phase des politischen aktivismus weil das versagen der linken diesen rechtsruck zu veranworten hat von europa bis zu den usa das haben wir ja schon längst klargestellt aber wir sind nicht im dritten reich warum ist das wohl so selbstkritik würde der linken besser tun als gewalt anzuwenden i can only advise every actvist out there to rethink that strategy it failing use your mind they have the guns und du meinst daß gewalt das ändert und nicht die besseren argumente es muss also den massen eingeprügelt werden we didn t speak about richard spencer we spoke about activism in general spencer won t get very far with his views der aufstieg des faschismus die usa sind noch eine demokratie ein republikanischer präsident kann das nicht ändern da liegt das problem um solche richtig zu erfahren muss man frau sie richtig schauen if you want violent protests it your decision i am not part of that i just gave advice here der kern ist sehr klein zu klein leider hat hillary clinton das geändert indem sie damit trump bekämpfen wollte du hast zu lange vor computern gesessen schau ihn nochmal in d und dann neon demon that is wrong on all levels and dangerous to tweet this is an image from world war ii has nothing to do with protests in a democracy dass du nicht lost river verstehst überrascht mich etwas im dritten reich war dies der fall wir sind aber weit davon entfernt da liegt der unterschied ich habe vorhin getweetet wenn eine gesellschaft in barbarei übergeht muss man leider gewalt anwenden um leben zu retten the point is once you move to violence against a dictatorship state you will lose always it not because i can t repeat the book on twitter it the essential manual for every activist damit stimme ich nicht überein diese kleine gruppe kann vielleicht nicht überzeugt werden die breitere masse schon und da meinst du ernsthaft daß gewalt die gesellschaft vor dem faschismus beschützt wahnsinn wir leben aber nicht im faschismus und das ist entscheidend in der diskussion the important tweet was about gene sharp book from dictatorship to democracy interesting that you missed this because that where the state wins to battle ideas is far more difficult but read gene sharp"

are very thoughtful and put your th no it is not a big deal for me as i enjoy showing i did an enneagram test once and i think i got w anyway i want to explore myself further i m planning to take more professional tests which will discover me more and i can improve myself this depends on the significance of the event or tournament however for example i just want to win and focus on the results of winning i m ill prepared for losing when i lose it utterly destroys me i think i ve now confirmed that i m an infj i use ne but i just don t really like to focus on the different possibilities hmm that looks interesting i ll save it for future reference for following those there are times where i can be turbulent and other times where i can be assertive however it so easy to degrade calling myself the worst names but i try hard to not do that it also puts me deeper in the hole i ve been feeling loneliness and depression for pretty much my whole life somewhat i mean i have difficulties in the choices i make i can make choices but i don t feel excitement in some cases what do you mean by loop of darkness i did personalities again infj t one tendancy i have is i m generally a lazy person but once i m actually bothered for example with organising i will organise it heavily this is what i mean they are both important lmao what i find funny is that on these tests i can exactly tell what these questions will influence for each trait that good self love is a very important asset i m still trying to find it myself i m going to do some mbti tests now this was my result on personalities on which mbti type i am a while ago i wonder if best friends actually exist i get envious of people who have been great friends for many years i feel like i always screw up welp i m in my period of loneliness at the moment just happens randomly but you know what i may try lol soon seems interesting way too many to list haha i have everything aside from xbox one this is what i follow very strictly what games would you recommend don t really play video games much lately but i used to play final fantasy xiv a lot pretty bored just relaxing haha how is everyone doing today now i m so bored i actually ranted from the heart for once i m learning how to sweettalk trolls hahahaha questions confessions or just simply want to vent what is tough however is that i feel that i have to show it in order to get the attention from somebody my pain and suffering is not easily visible i shouldn t have to act sick to let you know my outside doesn t represent my inside every single one of you who reads my tweets and especially ones that do interact with me deep down in my heart i truly love amp appreciate it the challenge with twitter is i need to fit everything in characters for your viewing convenience and i try hard to do that i like being completely honest in regards to the way i feel in my personal life i try my best into putting my thoughts into words and i m saying my thoughts amp feelings all of you guys who interact with me whether it here on twitter or curiouscat means a lot to me it really nice knowing that i have many people following this account it like you all are in front of me as an audience and i m noticing in myself that i m starting to be more expressive and open on this account i m bored do you play overwatch if so what platform i play i do not it does look very interesting though fro do your parents have different mbti types than you i ve been trying to analyse the mbti types in my fa that being said i feel like a hypocrite giving advice because i struggle with applying it to myself i generally do not like generalising other infjs like say infjs do xyz because everyone is different and i may even get some things wrong are you a night owl or an early bird both really i wish i could be awake all the time victoria islamic center rebuildingi donated yup to be honest i m thinking of changing my name and handle on here labels can get really unhealthy for me what i m afraid of is saying something constructive regardless of length and then everyone jumps on me in regards to the point i made snarky comments aimed towards me boil my blood i wish i could you know just chill with you for a while in the open yes but not anyone close to us i don t even just mean it in a romantic sense either i wonder what love truly feels like do you

harmony due to what new hobby are you looking forward tl learning learning how to self teach myself haha i also wan i m only human though i try to answer as much as i can but please don t feel down if i don t respond to you it doesn t mean i dislike you if anyone usefully interacts with me on this account i ll try to not ignore you i hate it when anyone feel left out i really dislike favoritism say

hands i ll melt quiet people have the loudest minds i ve heard one of our own is our ideal match it could work out very well with time guys can be a little slow no matter type that def makes sense then i m friends with an infj guy amp i hit it off with him really quickly before i knew his type i am so having that issue too and logic says what is the point but ni is too focused to care very annoying weird feeling type i have found certain types easier to connect to as if it more natural def gonna be very uncomfortable because you re not used to doing it so early on i sure don t do you know this person type doing right by others is easy natural even the struggle is doing right by me had to come back amp retweet because it keeps coming to mind why do we do this to ourselves even when we know better geez perhaps ni goes on an adventure that ti can girl i feel ya it might actually be okay if it equaled some form of productivity in the end ha kind of like blood type o i can give to all but take only from my small close circle um ouch lol seriously tho don t accept the applause of men and you won t be destroyed by their criticism there infinite wisdom in that statement people tend to stop listening to me long before i m done speaking it kind of sad when we end up accepting that just how it is plus with fe we are used to putting our feelings aside often choosing rather to focus on someone else i don t think infjs typically like to rely on others emotionally maybe because we don t think people care or we re independent almost every day why do we do this to ourselves i concur takes conscious effort for sure very needful for us tho or we get ourselves into trouble sad but true idealism smh what can i say i ve learned some hard lessons the long way around haha amp i m so much happier for it might as well share wedefinitely believe this as we are always striving to become a better version of ourselves it better to do something imperfectly than to do nothing flawlessly gotta work on thatmentality intjs use ni te fi se that the infj function stack in the pic i used to too you can grow amp it can get better now i know it their problem not mine so it more annoying than hurtful if you believe it will work out you ll see opportunities if you believe it won t you ll see obstacles this is one of the best amp deepest descriptions on the infj personality type that i ve found thoughts anyone i m often indecisive because i see multiple sides to everything all or nothing obsessed or uninterested get it done or procrastinate i don t typically do anything half way you re a lot stronger than you think practice setting boundaries i had to learn to be more assertive amp i am so thankful that i did you decide what you allow just always remember their behavior is a reflection of their character not yours it never defines you only them where your focus there always something to be happy about if we ll really look which can be a challenge at times maybe remind her of your love amp support as her friend regardless of your personal opinion when you feel like sharing it any takers odd right an encounter i had today made me think some infjs must be mistyped tho the online tests can type wrong we are able to think very logically yet willing to disregard logic if our intuition tells us otherwise so guilty we try to be the love amp give the attention we never received especially to the broken or the underdog as anespecially it is very important that we learn to set healthy boundaries from the outside looking in it hard to understand from the inside looking out it hard to explain sometimes the greater good we can accomplish is making a difference to one person at a time and that quite alright this entj is excellent at explaining the difference between ni amp ne in this video amp others if anyone is interested there are plenty of difficult obstacles in life don t allow yourself to become one of them a little advice from a shark feelings can t really get hurt only our ego something i m working on letting go of it has helped me a ton already i think it more turbulent infjs that wear their emotions on their sleeves more i m actually quite stoic so i ve been told i m pretty sure that actually typical of an infj have you watched personality hacker infj video they explain it a bit until you realize that it their problem amp a result of their character they don t define your worth but their own character the internal panic amp nervousness you get when you are told to call someone even if it just the pizza guy fitting in is not the objective when it rains look for rainbows when it dark look for stars at your absolute best you still won t be good enough for the wrong person at your worst you ll still be worth it to the right person ni seeing discrepancy in someone logic story without even consciously trying to we just know when things don t add up i really believe this is one of the keys to happiness good or bad feedback learn to keep others opinions se begin facing the fears that hold you back by doing something every day that scares you like go ahead amp share an o it often difficult to differ between how i feel amp what i think i get lost in thoughts amp feelings amp can t tell which is which what others thought of me never held me back it was only my fear of criticism that kept me in chains time to stop trying to fit in pretty much you re welcome thank you as well go ahead make a plan i dare you life agreed i m learning to be much more assertive amp communicative amp it already made me so much happier even when th very saddening we live in a world where most prefer to take than give and givers are discouraged by being taken advantage of unfortunately not everyone can they re just not wired for it ever studied fe vs fi it a deep subject but super interesting ever experienced it i ve got problems and of them are completely made up scenarios in my head that i m stressing about for

who married and one who not he was friends with her brother and just started talking she an enfj i look around and see so many people who have problems much bigger than mine i then tell myself i have no right to feel the way i do the problem with being so intuitive is that i can understand why ppl are hurtful so i tell myself i shouldn t be hurt ya i feel you sounds challenging i am sensitive which doesn t help i feel really good when i can be there for someone people who first reaction is to smile are the best there no such thing as too much love even if it not your love language i would say for other ppl in law i am a calming presence and act as a mediator counselor often just not by parents mom istj dad istp bro intp i m seen as dramatic cuz i don t say i m upset until it now built up don t really see eyeeye if you would bother to ask i would bother to tell people try to love us the best they know how often it isn t the way we want i relate to all of that i think i am a w but it surprising to me to think of myself as peace seeker fam wouldnt agree i know hate conflict and act as mediator often repress anger can be lazy when healthy look more like unhealthy like i guess im trying to figure out if i really am a w i relate to most stuff about but not description of child i was really involved with sports school youth programs as a kid teen like a healthy three then i turned what about u did you have that experience i feel like who i actually am and who i came off as or at least how i was perceived by my parents are entirely different ppl i feel like i showed anger a lot more too as a kid i have a younger brother who i fought with a lot i was more outgoing too cool do you mind if i ask you a question what were you like as a child i sometimes have to remind myself that this is only a chapter of my life not my entire book thanks for the advice often it less what i say but i will save a pin or share something on facebook that hits a nerve don t infjs often avoid developing their fe and so therefore tend to keep things to themselves like fi a lot of the conversations in my head are fights i will never have there is rage beneath the surface that i never show i have a friend who takes my opinions as personal attacks on her life i just want to be me which includes always expanding my opinion i tested as a but based on everything i ve read i relate most to w i despise conflict cool what do you feel like most separates you from other infjs i am often jealous offor their likeability across almost all types hubby is isfj and gets along with almost everyone it funny when ppl want to be infjs to be unique as ani often resent my uniqueness my fe craves connection but ni can be intense cool that what i think i am too this actually makes a lot of sense to me i ve been thinking my isfp friend is probably an enneagram i often feel torn between my family and my spouse i want both to be happy but usually when it comes to family events someone loses ooh that makes sense i could see that thanks for the info but i only have myself to blame my walls are thick and high i prefer to hide instead of showing how broken i am i feel like my family only sees me the way they saw me as a child they don t understand how much of who i was is not who i now am agreed which is why i don t trust tests but the studying of functions lol or do you mean enneagram i m new to that any other out there i just read a piece on personality junkie that says most infjs are when your ni has a vision but is hard to get se there so you take out frustration using fe and while ti is like not a big deal i don t think anything hurts me as much as when people purposefully disconnect me from their life as an when i become depressed i stop feeling anything i become catatonic life is just meaningless what does the learning process look like for you do you feel like all things are possible or do you reject quite a bit we are special not because of our individual qualities but our sum total of who we are some days i feel melancholy for no particular reason it like i lean into the darkness when you become suddenly aware of how meaningless your existence is to someone else but they had an impact on your life when you stare in the mirror trying to see into your own soul sometimes when i zoom out and see the big picture the weight of how small and insignificant i am it almost too much to bear mymom is planning my child birthday party becauseget stuff done my little brother is anhe is clearly the person with the highest iq in my family and he knows it too when i m having a conversation in my head and randomly blurt out things like anyways or nevermind or that nice i m sitting in a restaurant deep in thought when suddenly aware that i m overeating it hard to be present sometimes intuition is a very powerful thing more powerful than intellect steve jobs is this why i m never happy i m a victim of my own mind some days i amaze myself others i walk into a door i m not addicted to drugs or alcohol i m addicted to escaping reality unknown i parent by looking at the big pic is what i m teaching you today going to help you to be a better adult i often feel like i fluctuate between being emotionally cold logical to being overly emotional there is no middle for me i feel sometimes torn between wanting to look nice have nice things and thinking that material things looking good doesn t matter i wish i lived in a society where my talents are easily identified and clear cut like on theshow myfriend has a very unique and unapologetic style i am envious of how free she seems doesnt worry what others think often i feel so lost in my thoughts that i am blind to the world around me i wonder what it like to be anor when i struggle to type someone i feel at a loss of how to connect with them based on their functions does anyone else stock someone i meet someone and i think we could be friends so i creep social media i thought it was normal to stress passing a stranger on the sidewalk do i say hi do i look away nope social anxiety all i can be is me haven t been single in many years but i use to try to be cool chill funny goofy so i would make fun of laugh at myself i like aprils humor from parks and rec i wouldn t be like her in person but i found her morbid jokes funny of the time are so awesome they are more curious about the world than i am we can just talk and learn from each other i never lived in a dorm i use to fantasize about living on campus and making friends with my roommates bahaha i know better now hubby is always looking out and taking care of me he focuses on the here and now so i can focus on the big pic and future my mil is anshe is always creating something new some blanket or doll clothes or something the lone adventurer that would be my dad if there was ever a zombie apocalypse you d want him there my fil is anhe often gets embarrassed by his crazy ideas of life but it doesn t seem crazy to me at all i just get it i m new to enneagram i m still learning but it seems like we ve had similar thoughts i try to avoid negative emotions too i wondered that too when becomes

up w latest trends it deals in such minutiae tt it identifies every tree yet fails to notice the forest create an environment for respondents tt replicates as closely as possible the place n mood they will be in when they hv contact w a brand the more at ease n better mood people are the more info people will share it never just a creative brief not just a task to bang out a piece of paper to put into the system let put some real effort in never forget to convey what u think is a communication hook in a campaign in terms of tangible consumer benefits how do u train yourself to keep one foot outside the conversation n encourage research respondents to do the same what is the delicate balance between being involved enough to make informed decisions n being detached enough to see things clearly one aspect of qualitative research rarely spoken bout is the need to experiment in the first or groups on what questions r most useful such improvements are more likely to be achieved through the use of subjectivity n creativity than by objectivity ideas either hv potential but need to be simplified clarified or hv serious probs n require some surgery to put em back on the right track coming up with trends for the sake of it sometimes makes one grasp at weeds just because they are something new gut instinct based on experience and observation and living in this world is to be considered together with commissioned research embrace the inherent unpredictability of people recognise whole is greater than sum of its parts and wider context we live in not only is it impt to know
